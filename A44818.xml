            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>REader, in this ſmall Book you will find ſuch Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Recreations, that nothing of the nature ever appeared ſo like Accompliſh'd in any one Volume, of what Largeneſs ſoever: For beſides my own Experience in theſe acceptable and delightful Particulars, reduced under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Heads, eaſy to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and put in practice; I have taken the Opinions of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:109118:4"/>
whoſe Ingenuity hath led them to theſe Exerciſes in Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or General, and are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the Performance of them in the exacteſt manner, whoſe judicious Approbations the more embolden'd me to a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of them: In which you will not only find Pleaſure, and keep up a Healthful Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in moderately purſuing them, but in moſt or all of them find conſiderable Profit and Advantage, when you can ſpare leiſure Hours from your Devotions, or to unbend your Cares after the tireſome Drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery of weighty <hi>Temporal Matters;</hi> Not that I think it is proper ſo eagerly to purſue
<pb facs="tcp:109118:4"/>
them, as if you made them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Buſineſs</hi> than a <hi>Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> for though in themſelves they are harmleſs, yet a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual or inſatiate Proſecution of any Thing, not only leſſens the Pleaſure, but may render it hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, if not to your ſelf, yet in giving Offence to others, who will be apt to reflect upon ſuch as ſeem to doat upon them, and wholly neglect their other Affairs.</p>
            <p>We find the Taſte of Honey is delicious and deſirable, yet Nature over-burthened with too great a Quantity, Surfeits, and begets a loathing of it. Wherefore to Conclude, I commend them as they are, <hi>viz.</hi> Suitable <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations</hi> for the <hi>Gentry</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:109118:5"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> and others, wherein to pleaſe and delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

               <head>OF HUNTING.</head>
               <p>HUNTING, being a Recreation that challenges the ſublime Epithets of Royal, Artificial, Manly, and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, for its Statelineſs, Cunning, and Indurance, claims above all other Sports the Precedency; and therefore I was induced to place it at the Head to uſher in the reſt.</p>
               <p>But to come to the Purpoſe: The young Hunter, as yet raw in the true Knowledge of this Royal Sport, with what is meerly neceſſary and uſeful, without amuſing him with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Obſervations for his Inſtruction: I ſhall therefore obſerve throughout this Treatiſe this Method: 1. The ſeveral <hi>Chaſes</hi> or Games which fall under the Firſt Denomination, Hunting. 2. The genuine of Infallible Rules whereby we are to direct our ſelves, for the obtaining the true Pleaſure in proſecuting the ſame, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Effects of it.</p>

                  <p>As for the Terms of Art appropriated to Hunting.

                  <head>Of Hounds.</head>
                  <p>There are ſeveral kinds of Hounds, endued with Qualities ſuitable to the Country where they are bred; and therefore conſult his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and you will ſoon underſtand his Nature and Uſe: As for inſtance, the Weſtern Countries of <hi>England,</hi> and Wood-land, Mountainous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109118:7"/>
as alſo <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> breed the <hi>ſlow-Hound;</hi> a large great Dog, tall and heavy. <hi>Worceſterſhire, Bedfordſhire,</hi> and many other well mixt Soyls, where the Champaign and Covert are equally large, produce the <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſized</hi> Dog, of a more nimble Compoſure than the fore-mentioned, and fitter for Chaſe. <hi>Yorkshire, Cumberland, Northumberland,</hi> and the North parts, breed the Light, Nimble, ſwift ſlender Dog. And our open Champaigns train up excellent Grey-Hounds, hugely admired for his Swiftneſs, Strength, and Sagacity. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the little <hi>Beagle</hi> bred in all Countries, is of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Cunning, and curious Scent in Hunting.</p>
                  <p>For the Choice of Hounds we are to rely much on their Colours, and accordingly make our Election. The Beſt and moſt Beautiful of all for a general Kennel, is, the White Hound, with Black Ears, and a black ſpot at the ſetting on of the Tail, and is ever found to be both of good Scent, and good Condition, and will Hunt any Chaſe, but eſpecially the <hi>Hare, Stag, Buck Roe,</hi> or <hi>Otter,</hi> not ſticking at Woods or Waters. The next is the Black, the blacktann'd, or all Liver-hew'd, or the milk White Hound, which is the true <hi>Talbot,</hi> is beſt for the ſtring, or line, as delighting in Blood; the Largeſt is the comlieſt and beſt. The <hi>Grizled,</hi> uſually ſhag-hair'd, are the beſt Verminers; and ſo fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for the <hi>Fox, Badger,</hi> or other hot Scents; a couple of which let not your Kennel be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, as being exceeding good cunning Finders.</p>
                  <p>For the Shape of your Hound, you muſt conſult the Climate of his Breed, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Compoſition of his Body; but by theſe following Characters you may know a good
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109118:7"/>
Hound. If you like a large, heavy, true <hi>Talbot</hi> like Hound, ſee</p>
                  <p>His Head be round and thick. Noſe ſhort and upriſing. Noſtrils wide and large. Ears large and down-hanging. Upper-lip-Flews lower than his Nether Chaps. Back ſtrong and riſing. Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets thick and great. Thighs and Huckle-bones round. Hams ſtreight. Tail long and ruſh grown. The Hair of his Belly hard and ſtiff. Legs big and lean. Foot like a <hi>Fox</hi>'s, well clawed and round. Sole dry and hard. All theſe ſhew an able Hound.</p>
                  <p>If you would chooſe a ſwift light Hound, the <hi>Yorkshire</hi> one in the generality will pleaſe you; for that (as theſe have) the ought to have a ſlenderer Head, longer Noſe, ſhallower Ears and Flews, broad Back, gaunt Belly, ſmall Tail, long Joynts, round Foot; and in fine of a Gray-Hound-like Make.</p>
                  <p>Thus much to direct the choice of Hounds; now ſomething ought to be ſpoken of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Kennels, wherein I muſt appeal to the Affection of the Gentleman, the Lover of this Sport, and let him tell me the Reaſons that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him take pleaſure in Hounds, whether it be he fancies Cunning in Hunting? Or Sweetneſs, Loudneſs, or Deepneſs of Cry? Or for the Training his Horſes? Or for the Exerciſe of his Body only?</p>
                  <p>If for Cunning Hunting; breed your Dogs from the ſloweſt and largeſt of the forementioned Northern Hounds, and the ſwifteſt and ſlendereſt of the Weſt Country, of both Kinds, approved to be not given to lie off, or look for Advantages, but ſtaunch, fair, even running, and of perfect fine Scent. Theſe will make a Horſe gallop faſt, and not run; being middle-ſiz'd; not too ſwift as to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109118:8"/>
out-run, or too ſlow as to loſe the Scent; are the beſt for the true Art and Uſe of Hunting.</p>
                  <p>If for Sweetneſs of Cry; compound your Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of ſome large Dogs, of deep ſolemn Mouths, and ſwift in ſpending, as the <hi>Baſe</hi> in the Conſort; then twice ſo many roaring, loud ringing Mouths, as the <hi>Counter-Tenor:</hi> And laſtly, ſome hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low plain ſweet Mouths, as the <hi>Mean:</hi> So ſhall your Cry be perfect. Obſerve that this Compoſition be of the ſwifteſt and largeſt deep Mouth'd Dog, the ſloweſt and middle-ſiz'd, and the ſhorteſt Leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſlender Dog. For theſe run even together.</p>
                  <p>If for Loudneſs of Mouth, chooſe the Loud clanging (redoubling as it were) Mouth, and to this put the roaring, ſpending, and Whining Mouth, which will be loud, ſmart, and pleaſant: Such are for the moſt part your <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> and <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> Dogs.</p>
                  <p>If (laſtly) for deegneſs of cry, the largeſt dogs having the greateſt Mouths, and deepeſt flews, are the beſt; ſuch are your Weſt-Country, <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Dogs.</p>
                  <p>But if you have your Kennel for Training Horſes only; then compound your Kennel of the lighteſt, nimbleſt, and ſwifteſt Dogs, ſuch as your Northern Hounds are. For the ſtrong and violent Exerciſes of their Horſes, through the Natural Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity of their Hounds, in the North parts, have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd them famous for Truth and Swiftneſs above all other parts of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If for the Maintenance of your Health, by preventing Infirmities and Groſſneſs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, you compoſe your Kennel; conſult firſt your own Ability for this Exerciſe; and if you think you are able to foot it away, then the Biggeſt and ſloweſt Dogs you can get are beſt.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109118:8"/>
But if you would pad it away through an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of footing it, than chooſe the ſloweſt or middle-ſiz'd Hounds, of good Mouths and Noſes, for loud Cry, and ready Scent.</p>
                  <p>Thus far for the Compoſing a Kennel: I come now to the <hi>Kennel it ſelf,</hi> of which I need ſay little, as indeed unneceſſary, leaving that to the Diſcretion of the <hi>Huntſman;</hi> only I would have him obſerve, that it be built ſome pretty way diſtant from the Dwelling-Houſe, in a warm dry Place, free from Vermine, and near ſome Pond or River of freſh Water; and ſo placed, that the Morning Sun may ſhine upon it. Be ſure to keep it clean, and let them not want freſh Straw every day. Feed them early in the Morning at Sun-riſing, and at Sun-ſet in the Evening. As for the Meat, I leave to the ingenious Huntſman to get when they come from Hunting; after you have fed them well, let them to their Kennel, and waſh their Feet with Beer and Butter, or ſome ſuch thing, and pick and ſearch their Cleys, for Thorns, Stubs, or the like: If it is in <hi>Winter,</hi> let a Fire be made, and let them beak and ſtretch themſelves for an hour or ſo at the fire, and ſuffer them to lick, pick, and trim themſelves; hereby to prevent the <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> incident to them, upon ſudden Cooling, as the <hi>Mange, Itch, Fevers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But before I treat of the keeping your Hounds in Health by curing their Diſeaſes, I muſt ſpeak a Word or two of the way to <hi>Breed good Whelps,</hi> viz. Having a Hound and a Bratch of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Goodneſs in Size, Voice, Speed, Scent, and Proportion you like, put them together to ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in <hi>January, February,</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt Months for Hounds, Bitches, and Bratches to be Limed in; becauſe of not <hi>loſing time</hi> to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109118:9"/>
enter them. When you put them together, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, as near as you can, if the <hi>Moon</hi> be in <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> or <hi>Gemini;</hi> becauſe the Whelps will then never run Mad, and the Litter will be double as many Dogs, as Bitch-Whelps. When your Bitch is near her <hi>Whelping,</hi> ſeparate her from the other Hounds, and make her a Kennel particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by her ſelf; and ſee her Kennell'd every Night, that ſhe might be acquainted and delighted with it, and ſo not ſeek out unwholſom Places; for if you remove the Whelps after they are Whelp'd, the Bitch will carry them up and down till ſhe come to their firſt Place of Littering; and that's very dangerous. Suffer not your Whelps to Suck above two Months, and then <hi>Wean</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>When your Whelps are brought up, <hi>enter</hi> them not into Hunting till they are at leaſt a Year and half old: That is, if whelpt in <hi>March,</hi> enter them <hi>September</hi> come Twelve Month; if in <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril,</hi> in <hi>October</hi> come Twelve Months after, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When you would <hi>enter</hi> them, bring them abroad, with the moſt Staunch and beſt Hunting Hounds; (all babling and flying Curs being left at home:) and a <hi>Hare being the best entering Chaſe,</hi> get a <hi>Hare</hi> ready before, and putting her from her Form, view which way ſhe takes, and then lay on your Hounds, giving them all the Advantages may be; if ſhe is caught, do not ſuffer them to break her, but immediately taking her, ſtrip off her Skin, and cutting her to pieces, give every part to your young Whelps; and that will beget in them a Delight in Hunting.</p>

                  <p>To underſtand the <hi>Age</hi> of this our Game, it is known by ſeveral Marks, amongſt which this is the moſt authentick: That if you take
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109118:10"/>
his view in the ground, and perceive he has a large Foot, a thick Heel, a deep Print, open Cleft and long ſpace, then be aſſured he is Old; as the Contrary concludes him Young.</p>
                  <p>To find him? Examine the following Annual, or Monethly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>November,</hi> in Heaths among Furs, Shrubs, and Whines.</p>

                     <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> after the firſt ſhowers of Rain, they leave their Thickets, and go to Rut, during which time there is no certain place to find them in.</p>
                  <p>When you have found him in any of theſe places, be careful to go up the Wind; and the beſt time to find him is before <hi>Sun-riſing,</hi> when he goes to feed; then watch him to his Leir, and having lodged him, go and prepare; if he is not forced, he will not badge till Evening. Approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Lodging, caſt off your <hi>Finders,</hi> who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hunted him a Ring or two, caſt in the reſt; and being in full Cry and maine Chaſe, Comfort and Cheer them with Horn and Voice.

they have either ſet up or ſlain him.

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In <hi>Winter</hi> they love Tuffs of Thorns and Brambles, near Houſes: In theſe places you muſt regard the <hi>Oldneſs</hi> or <hi>Newneſs</hi> of her <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Seat,</hi> to prevent Labour in Vain: If it be plain and ſmooth within, and the Pad before it flat and worn, and the Prickles ſo new and perceptible, that the Earth ſeems black, and freſh broken, then aſſure your ſelf the Form is new, and from thence you may Hunt and recover the <hi>Hare;</hi> if the contrary, it is old, and if your <hi>Hounds</hi> call upon it, rate them off.

               <head>Of RIDING.</head>
               <p>HERE we muſt firſt examine the Ends and Deſign of our propoſing this Art to our ſelves, and accordingly lay down as briefly as may be the neceſſary Rules and Leſſons are to be obſerved and learnt; and I take theſe to be the uſual Perfections we aim at, <hi>To ride well the great</hi> Horſe, <hi>for the Wars or Service, and the</hi> Horſe <hi>for Pleaſure;</hi> of both which as conciſely as I can, in their order.</p>
               <p>We muſt begin with <hi>Taming, a young Colt.</hi> After you have kept him at home ſome time, and made him ſo Familiar with you, as to ſuffer <hi>Combing, Currying, Handling,</hi> and <hi>Stroaking</hi> any part, 'tis high time then to offer him the Saddle, which you muſt lay in the <hi>Manger</hi> firſt, that by its ſmell, he may not be afraid of it, or the <hi>Styr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups</hi> Noiſe. Then gently ſaddling him (after his dreſſing) take a ſweet <hi>Watering Trench,</hi> anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Honey and Salt, and place it in his Mouth ſo, that it may hang directly over his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109118:13"/>
                  <hi>Tuſh;</hi> then lead him abroad in your hand, and Water him; and after he has ſtood an hour rein'd take off his Bridle and Saddle, and let him feed till Evening; then do as in the Morning; dreſs and Cloath him, having <hi>Cheriſht,</hi> by the Voice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered ſmoothly and gently; or by the Hand by gently ſtroaking and clapping him on the neck, or Buttock; or laſtly by the <hi>Rod,</hi> by rubbing it on his Withers or Main.</p>
               <p>On the next day as before; and after that, put him on a ſtrong <hi>Muſrole,</hi> or ſharp <hi>Cavezan,</hi> and <hi>Martingale;</hi> which is the beſt guide to a Horſe for ſetting his head in due place, forming the Rein, and appearing Graceful and Comely; it Corrects the yerking out his Head, or Noſe, and prevents his running away with his Rider. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve therefore to place it right, that it be not buckled ſtraight, but looſe, and ſo low, that it reſt on the tender Grizſle of his Noſe, to make him the more ſenſible of his fault, and Correction; and ſo as you ſee you win his Head, bring him ſtraighter by degrees; let him but gently feel it, till his Head be brought to its true perfection.</p>
               <p>Having obſerved this well, lead him forth into ſome ſoft or new Plowed Land, trot him about in your hand a good while: Then offer to Mount; if he refuſe to ſuffer you, trot him again; then putting your foot into the <hi>Styrrop,</hi> mount half way; if he takes it impatient, correct him, and about again; if not, cheriſh him, and place your ſelf a moment in the Saddle, diſmount, cheriſh, and feed him with <hi>Graſs,</hi> or <hi>Bread:</hi> All things being well, remount, even in the Saddle, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Rod from his Eye; then let one lead him by the <hi>Chaff-Halter,</hi> and ever and a-non make him ſtand, and cheriſh him, till he will of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109118:14"/>
his own accord go forward; then come home, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light gently, <hi>dreſs and feed him well.</hi> This Courſe in few dayes will bring him to Trot, by following ſome other Horſe-man, ſtop him now and then gently, and forward; not forgetting ſeaſonable <hi>Cheriſhings</hi> and <hi>Corrections,</hi> by Voice, <hi>Bridle, Rod, Spurs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being thus brought to ſome certainty of <hi>Rein,</hi> and <hi>Trotting</hi> forth-right, then to the treading <hi>forth of the large Rings.</hi> And here firſt examine your Horſes Nature, before you chooſe your Ground, for, if his Nature be dull and ſloathful, yet ſtrong, then <hi>New-Plow'd-Field</hi> is beſt; if <hi>Active, Quick,</hi> and <hi>Fiery,</hi> then <hi>Sandy-ground</hi> is to be preferred; in the moſt proper of which mark out a large Ring, of a Hundred paces circumference. Walk about it on the right ſeven or eight times, then by a little ſtraightning your right Rein, and laying your left leg calf to his ſide, make a half Circle within the Ring upon your right down to its Center; then by ſtraightning a little your left Rein, and laying your right Leg Calf to his ſide, make a half Circle to your left hand, from the Center to the outmoſt Verge, and theſe you ſee contrary turned make a Roman S. Now to your firſt large Compaſs, walk him about on your left hand, as oft as before on the right, and change to your right within your Ring; then Trot him firſt on the right-hand, then on the left, as long as you judge fit, and as often Mornings and Evenings, as the Nature of your Horſe ſhall require. In the ſame manner you may make him to <hi>Gallop</hi> the ſame Rings, though you muſt not enter it all at once, but by degrees, firſt a Quarter, then a Half-quarter; and the Lightneſs and Cheerfulneſs of your Body, not the Spur, muſt induce him to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:109118:14"/>The next Leſſon is to <hi>Stop Fair, Comely,</hi> and without Danger, Firſt ſee that the Ground be hard and firm, then having cheriſht your Horſe, bring him to a ſwift Trot, about Fifty Paces, and then ſtraightly &amp; ſuddenly draw in your Bridle hand; then eaſe a little your hand to make him give backward, and in ſo doing, give him liberty and cheriſh him; then drawing in your Bridle hand, make him retire, and go back; if he ſtrike, eaſe your hand: if he refuſe, let ſome by-ſtander put him back, that he may learn your intention and thus he may learn theſe two Leſſons at once.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To Advance before,</hi> when he ſtoppeth, is thus taught: When you ſtop your Horſe, without eaſing your hand, lay cloſe and hard to his ſides both Calves of your Legs, and ſhaking your Rod cry, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p;</hi> which he will underſtand by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Repetition, and Practice: This is a Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and Comely Motion, makes a Horſe Agile, and Nimble, and ready to turn; and therefore be careful in it: That he take up his Legs Even to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and bending to his Body; not too high, for fear of his coming over; not ſprawling, or pawing; or for his own pleaſure; in theſe faults correct him with Spur and Rod.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Yerk out behind</hi> is the next Leſſon, thus learnt, Preſently upon your making him ſtop give him a good brisk jerk near his Flank, which will make him ſoon underſtand you. When he does it, cheriſh him; and ſee he does it comely, for to yerk out his hinder Legs, till his Forelegs be above Ground, is not graceful; or one Leg yerk't farther out than the other; or one Leg out while the other is on the Ground; in this caſe a ſingle Spur on the faulty ſide, is beſt. But to help him in Yerking, ſtaying his Mouth on the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109118:15"/>
Bridle, ſtriking your Rod under his Belly, or touching him on the Rump with it.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Turn readily on both hands,</hi> thus: Bring his large Rings narrower, and therein gently walk him, till acquainted. Then carry your Bridle-hand ſteady and ſtraight, the outmoſt rather ſtraighter than the inmoſt Rein, to look from, rather than to the Ring; trot him thus about, on one ſide and the other ſuceſſively, as aforeſaid. After ſome time ſtop, and make him advance twice or more, and retire in an even Line; then ſtop and cheriſh him. To it again, after the ſame manner, making him lap his outmoſt Leg above a foot over his Inner. And thus the <hi>Terra a Terra, Incavalere &amp; Chambletta,</hi> are all taught together. Perfect your Horſe in the large Ring, and the ſtraight Ring is eaſily learnt.</p>
               <p>Your Horſe being brought thus far to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with the <hi>Muſrole</hi> and <hi>Trench,</hi> now let a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Cavezan</hi> take their place; with a ſmooth Cannon-Bit in his Mouth, and a plain watering Chain, Cheek large, and the Kirble thick, round and big, looſely hanging on his nether Lip; and thus mount him, and perfect your Horſe with the <hi>Bit</hi> in all the aforeſaid Leſſons, as you did with the <hi>Snaffle;</hi> which indeed is the eaſier to be done of the two.</p>
               <p>To teach your Horſe <hi>To go a ſide,</hi> as a neceſſary Motion for ſhunning a blow from an Enemy, is thus: Draw up your Bridle hand ſomewhat ſtraight, and if you would have him go on the Right, lay your left Rein cloſe to his Ncek, and your left Calf likewiſe cloſe to his ſide (as in the <hi>Incavalere</hi> before) making him lap his left Leg over his Right; then turning your Rod backward jerking him on the left hinder Thigh gently, make
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109118:15"/>
him to bring to the right ſide his Hinder parts, and ſtand as at firſt in an even direct Line: Then make him remove his Fore parts more, that he may ſtand as it were Croſs over the even Line, and then bring his hinder parts after, and ſtand in an even Line, again. And thus you muſt do, if you would have him go on the Left hand, uſing your Corrections and Cheriſhings on the right. Uſe it, and you may be ſure of Perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Carreere,</hi> only take this: Let it not extend in length above ſix ſcore yards, give your Horſe warning before you ſtart him by the Bridle hand, and running full ſpeed, ſtop him ſuddenly, firm and cloſe on his Buttock.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Horſe of Pleaſure,</hi> theſe following Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are to be learnt. As firſt to <hi>Bound aloft,</hi> to do which: Trot him ſome ſixteen yards, then ſtop, and make him twice advance; then ſtraighten your Bridle-hand; then clap briskly both your Spurs even together to him, and he will riſe, tho' it may at firſt amaze him; if he does it, cheriſh him, and repeat it often every day, till perfect.</p>
               <p>Next to <hi>Corvet</hi> and <hi>Capriole</hi> are Motions of the ſame nature, and in ſhort are thus taught. Hollow the ground between two joyning Walls a Horſes length, by the ſide of which put a ſtrong ſmooth Poſt of the ſame length from the Wall, and faſten at the Wall an Iron Ring over againſt the Poſt: Thus done, ride into the hollow place, and faſten one of the <hi>Cavezan</hi> Reins to the Poſt, and the other to the Ring; then cheriſh him, and by the help of the Calves of your Legs, make him advance two or three times; then pauſe, and Cheriſh him; make him advance again a dozen times more, and then reſt;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:109118:16"/>
double your Advancings, and repeat them till it becomes habitual to him, to keep his Ground cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, advance of an <hi>equal hight</hi> before and behind, and obſerve a <hi>due Time</hi> with the motions of your Legs. The Inequality of his advancing his hinder Legs, is helpt by a Jerk on the Fillets by ſome body behind him with a Rod.</p>

               <p>The beſt Food for your <hi>Racer,</hi> is good, ſweet, well dryed, ſunned, and beaten <hi>Oats:</hi> Or elſe Bread made of one part Beans, and two parts <hi>Wheat (i. e.</hi>) two Buſhels of <hi>Wheat,</hi> to one of <hi>Beans,</hi> ground together: Boult through a fine Range half a Buſhel of fine <hi>Meal,</hi> and bake that into two or three Loaves by it ſelf, and with water

and good ſtore of <hi>Barm,</hi> knead up, and bake the reſt in great Loaves, having ſifted it through a <hi>Meal-ſieve:</hi> (But to your finer, you would do well to put the whites of Twenty or thirty <hi>Eggs,</hi> and with the <hi>Barm</hi> a little <hi>Ale,</hi> 'tis no matter how little water:) With the Courſer feed him on his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting days, on his Labouring days with the finer.</p>
               <p>The beſt time for feeding your <hi>Runner</hi> on his Reſting days is, after his Watering in the Morning, at One a Clock at Noon, after his watering in the Evening, and at nine or ten a Clock at nights: On his Days of Labour, two Hours after he is throughly Cold outwardly and inwardly, as before.</p>
               <p>As for the Proportion of Meat, I ſhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine your Love to a Quantity, only give him a little at once, as long as his Appetite is Good: When he begins to fumble and play with his Meat, hold your hand, ſhut up your Sack,</p>
               <p>As for his <hi>Exerciſe</hi> it ought to be thrice a Week, as his bodily Condition requires; if he be foul, moderate Exerciſe will break his Greaſe; if clean, then as you judge beſt, taking heed of breaking his Mettle, or diſcouraging him, or lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Limbs. Before you air him, to add to his Wind, it is requiſite to give him a raw Egg broken in his Mouth: if your Horſe be very fat, air him before Sun riſing and after Sun-ſet; if lean, deprive him not of the leaſt ſtrength and Comfort of the Sun you can deviſe. To make him Sweat ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by courſing him in his Cloaths is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, if moderate; but without his Cloaths, let it be ſharp and ſwift. See that he be empty before you courſe him; and it is wholeſome to waſh his Tongue and Noſtrils with <hi>Vinegar,</hi> or <hi>piſs</hi> in his Mouth, before you back him.

                  <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Recreation.</hi> How to make Artificial Fire-works of all ſorts, for Pleaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>OF Artificial Fire-works for Recreation, there are three general ſorts, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe that aſcend or mount in the Air. Thoſe that conſume on the Earth: And ſuch as burn on the Water. And theſe are again divided into three Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> For the Air, the Sky-Rocket, the flying Sauciſſon, and Balloon: For the Earth, the Ground-Rocket, the fiery Lances, and the Sauciſſons deſcendent. For the Water-Globes or Balls, double Rockets, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109118:18"/>
ſingle Rockets; and of theſe in their particular Orders, to make them, and ſuch other Matters, as may occur relating to Fire-works.</p>
               <p>But before I enter particularly on them, it will not be amiſs to give the Unlearned Inſtructions for making his Moulds for Rockets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Mould muſt be of a ſubſtantial piece of Wood, well ſeaſon'd, and not ſubject to ſplit or warp; and firſt the Caliber or Bore of it, being an Inch in Diameter; the Mould muſt be ſix Inches long, and Breech an Inch and half; the Broach that enters into the Choaking part, three Inches and a half long, and in Thickneſs a quarter of an Inch. The Rowler on which you wrap the Paper or Paſte board, being three quarters of an Inch Diameter, and the Rammer ſomewhat leſs, that it may eaſily paſs and re-paſs, made hollow to receive the Broach; for the Cartouſh Coffin muſt be filled with the Materials, the Broach being in.</p>
               <p>If the Bore be two Inches Diameter, the Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket muſt be twelve Inches in Length: If an Inch and a half in Bore, then nine Inches Long, and ſo proportionably to any other Diameter. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſh or Caſe muſt be either ſtrong Paper or fine Paſte-board, choaked within an Inch a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Top, rowled on the Rowler with a thin Paſte, to keep the Doublings the higher together, that it may have the greater force and higher flight. Having thus far conſidered your Mould and Cartouſh or Caſe, I proceed to the Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and filling part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> Sky-Rocket, <hi>how to make it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the Compoſition of your filling Materials be very cautious that you exceed not the juſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109118:19"/>
Proportion, for which I ſhall give Directions to be a Standard in this caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Having beat a Pound of Powder very fine, and ſifted it through a Lawn Sieve that no whole Corns remain in it; do the like by two Ounces of Charcole; then ſift them together, ſo that they may mix well, which done, fill a ſmall Rocket with this Mixture, and if it break in Mounting before it come to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed height, or burns out too fierce, then is there too much Powder, and more fine ſifted Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cole muſt be added; but if there be too much Charcole in the Compoſition, then upon tryal it will not aſcend, or very little.</p>
               <p>Obſerve in charging your Rocker, at every quarter of an ounce of Ingredients or thereabouts, you ram it down very hard, forcing your Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer with a wooden Mallet, or ſome weighty piece of Wood, but no Iron or Stone, for fear any Sparkles of Fire fly out and take your Combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Matter; ſo fill it by degrees: If you deſign neither to place Stars, Quills, or ſmall Rockets on its Head, you may put in about an Inch and a half of dry Powder for the Bounce, but if you are to place the fore-mention'd things on the Head of a great Rocket, you muſt cloſe down the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or Paſte-board very hard, and prick two or three holes with a Bodkin, that it may give fire to them when it Expires, placing a large Cartouſh or Paſte-board on the head of the Rocket, into which you muſt put the Stars or ſmall Rockets, Paper-Serpents, or Quill-Serpents; of which I ſhall ſpeak more hereafter.</p>
               <p>Note further, That if you would have your Rocket ſparkle much, you muſt put ſome groſly bruiſed Salt peter into the Compoſition; but then it muſt not lie long before it be let off, for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109118:19"/>
fear it give and damp the Powder. If you would have it leave a blue Stream, as it aſcends, put fine beaten and ſifted Sulphur into it, but of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe more than a third part of Charcole; and in this manner greater and leſſer Rockets are made, but the leſſer muſt have more Powder and leſs Charcole than the greater, by a fifth part in ſix.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Golden Rain, and Golden Hair.</head>
                  <p>For Golden Rain, or ſtreams of Fire, that will, when at height, deſcend in the Air like Rain: Take large Gooſe-Quills, take only the hollow Quill as long as may be, fill it with beaten Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Charcole; as for the Air Rocket only add a little Powder of Sulphur. Being hard filled to a quarter of an Inch, ſtop that with wet Powder, called Wild-fire; place as many as you think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient on the Head of a great Rocket, paſted on in a Rowl of Paper, ſo that it may not fall off till the Rocket burſts, there being a little dry Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in it to force the end when the ſtream of fire ceaſes, at which time they taking, will appear like a ſhower of Fire of a golden Colour, ſpreading themſelves in the Air, and then tending directly downwards. This is to be conſidered when you ſtand directly, or ſomething near under them; but if you are at ſome diſtance, then they will appear to you like the Blazing Tail of a Comet or Golden Hair.</p>

               <head>The Noble Science of Defence, in all its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful Particulars, for Defending and Offending, with the Rapier or final Sword; after the exacteſt Method now in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</head>
               <p>THis Science, if well underſtood, as to the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and uſing it, is not only a noble Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, but of great importance to the ſaving our lives on emergent Occaſions, if it extend not to Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory and Preſumption, by too much relying on our Skill, to carry us into quarrels, which we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, and without loſs of Honour or Reputation avoid. Wherefore I have thought it convenient to lay down ſuch Rules as may enable the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to proceed in the Practice.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing to be conſidered in this Caſe, is, the Sword it ſelf, underſtanding only in this the ſmall Sword or Rapier, which is divided
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:109118:38"/>
into two Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> The Hilt and the Blade.</p>
               <p>The Hilt is again divided into three Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pommel or Ball at the far end, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Round and ſometimes Oval in Shape. This keeps the Hilt faſt, by being well riveted, and by its poiſe makes the Sword well mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or light before the Hand. The next is that part on which you graſp your Hand, commonly called the Handle: and then the Shell, which is that part of the Hilt next the Blade, to preſerve your Hand (if you are any thing weary in manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it) from a Thruſt or Blow.</p>
               <p>The Blade is divided into two Parts only. The firſt next to the Hilt, being termed the ſtrong Part or Fort. The other, which is the extream, is termed the Feeble, or they are otherways termed the Prime, and the Second. The ſtrong Fort or Prime of the Blade, is meaſured from the Shell to the middle of the Blade, and being the ſtrongeſt, is made uſe of in Parying, or to put by Thruſts or Blows. The Feeble, weak or ſecond part, is accounted from the Middle to the Point, and is properly made uſe of in Offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or giving Thruſts or Blows; and thus much may ſerve for the Deſcription of the Sword: Now I proceed to the Explaination of the Terms, fit to be known by a Practitioner.</p>

                  <p>You have two ways with this Guard to defend your ſelf, either by Parying or uſing Contraries to what your Adverſary plays, as I ſhall more fully ſhew you when I come to diſcourſe of the five Parades; however here obſerve in the ſtrait Guard, which is moſt in uſe, to keep a thin Body, which is done by ſhewing your Right-ſide to your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, managing your feet in a ſtrait Line from him; ſo that for your Right he cannot ſee your Left-leg, yet ſet them not too wide, for that will make your Elong the ſhorter; nor too cloſe, for that will hinder the firmneſs of ſtanding; and let the Point of your Right foot be turned ſomewhat outwards from the ſtrait Line, but the broad ſide of your Left muſt look towards your Adverſary. You are alſo to ſink with your Thighs your Left-knee, a little more bent than your Right, which may be done by your leaning ſomewhat back on your Left-thigh; when you preſent your Sword, you muſt hold it with your Nails upwards, as has been directed in <hi>Quart.</hi> The Hilt of your Sword muſt be as high as your Right-pap, keeping your Arm a little bent, for the better and eaſier purſuing your Adverſary; or for the quicker giving in a Thruſt: The Point muſt be towards your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries Right-ſide, two or three Inches lower than the Hilt, your Left-hand held up as high as your Left-ear, about half a Foot from it, the Palm directly againſt your Adverſaries Face, your Fingers pointing as it were towards him.</p>

This is a very open Guard, yet to thoſe that know not how to purſue it, it is much Surprizing. And you may purſue this;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by raiſing up or gathering your Adverſaries Sword.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, by ſtriking at his Sword, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing half Thruſts at the Body, by which he will be doubtful when you intend to give in your Thruſt, and finding an Opportunity give it home; and ever when you perſue this Guard, let your Left-hand be in a readineſs to Parie your Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents Thruſt, if he Thruſt juſt as you are Thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is the main defence on this Guard.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly you may give a ſtroak at his Left-hand; after you give a beat at his Sword, and ſee if by ſo doing, you can force him to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to another Gaurd.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, You may Volt, and in your ſo doing, give him the Thruſt which being clearly done, will mainly ſurprize him.</p>

The next is called the Terce Parade, or the Parade without the Sword; for here, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the former, you put by the Thruſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſide which is without the Sword, and as the other is termed the Quart, for as much as it is within your Sword, or on that ſide your Nails look to; ſo this is called Terce becauſe it is without your Sword, or on that ſide the back of your Hand is to. Obſerve a little more, <hi>viz.</hi> when you are to hold your Hand or Nails in Terce, that you hold your Nails quite downward; And now to Parie theſe Five ſeveral ways.</p>
                  <p>you muſt do the firſt Parade in Quart, with the Point ſomewhat higher than the Hilt, <hi>viz.</hi> When you are ſtanding to your Guard, if your Adverſary offers to give a home Thruſt on that ſide his Sword lieth, which I preſume to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your Sword, without diſengaging and is the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:109118:43"/>
Simpleſt and plaineſt Thruſt that can be given with the ſmall Sword; yet frequently it ſurprizes a Man, I ſay, when ſo it is, that when you perceive your Adverſary offer to give a home Thruſt, which obſerve by keeping your Eye ſteady on the Hilt of his Sword; you muſt then immediatly turn your Wriſt with ſo ſmall a Motion of the Arm, that it can ſcarcely be perceived, to your Left-ſide; and by that means you may put by his Sword, with the Fort of yours upon the Left-ſide, keeping the Point of your Sword after the Parade towards his Right-ſhoulder; you may in putting by your Adverſaries Sword uſe a little beat or Spring towards the Ground, by which you will more certainly diſappoint him, immediately bringing your Sword to its right poſture again, and by this way of Parying you may have the luck to Spring or Beat your Adverſaries Sword out of his Hand.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Parade in Quart is with the Point ſloping towards your Adverſaries Right-thigh, and as tho' without it, in this manner;</p>
                  <p>When you perceive your Adverſary is thruſting with your Sword, turn the Nails of your Sword-hand in Quart, with a full ſtretched Arm, and your Hand as high as your Face, and when you do this, ſlope your Point to the lowneſs of your Adverſaries Thigh; and by that means, with the Fort of your Sword, on the Feeble of his, put by his Thruſt, always obſerving to Parie with the Fort of your Sword, and not the Feeble, leſt your Adverſary having the ſtronger Arm, force upon you the Thruſt in ſpite of all you can do.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Parade in Terce, or without the Sword, the Point a little higher than the Hilt, muſt be thus mannaged, <hi>viz.</hi> Perceiving your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:109118:43"/>
giving in the Thruſt without your Sword; take notice immediatly to turn your Wriſt with ſome ſmall motion of the Arm, as in the firſt Parie in Quart, till your Nails be in Terce, and ſo Parie his Thruſt, Remembring in this to keep the Point of your Sword, after you have Paried him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your Adverſaries Left-ſhoulder, as in the firſt Parade in Quart, you are to keep it towards his Right.</p>
                  <p>This Parade is moſt effectually done with a Spring, to put by the Sword or gain an advantage of diſarming your Adverſary.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Parade in Terce, is called that within the Sword bearing a ſloping Point towards your Adverſaries Thigh, and as though within it. This obſerve to do when you perceive your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary giving in his Thruſt without, or below your Sword, as it were at your Arm-pit, immediately letting the Point of your Sword ſink as low as his Thigh, turning your Nails quite round to your Right-ſide, until they are from you, keeping your Hand as high as your Head, and ſo put by the Thruſt on your Right-ſide; and when you are Parading, let your Head be cloſe as if it were under your Arm; and this preſerves your Face from your Adverſaries ſcattering or Counter-Temps Thruſts.</p>
                  <p>Thus having ſhewn you the Defenſive part, I ſhall now proceed to the Offenſive, or how you may offend your Adverſary when neceſſity requires it; but before I directly enter upon it, let me ſpeak ſome thing of the Counter-caveating Parade; though ſome there are who refuſe to uſe it, yet it is the ſafeſt of all.</p>

When you give in your Thruſt throw your Left-hand behind you, or ſo place it on your Left-ſide, that your Sword and both your Arms may make a ſtrait Line from your Adverſary. This muſt be when you deſign not to make uſe of your Left-hand for a Parade, but if you do, then in the very time of giving in your Thruſt,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:109118:45"/>
throw your Left-arm forward as far as you can, without putting the reſt of your Body into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorder, turning the Palm from you, by turning your Thumb down, and your little Fingers up, and ſo Parie your Adverſaries Thruſt, if you find he will Thruſt, upon the ſame time you make your Thruſt, always remembring when you Thruſt within the Sword, to do it with your Nails in Quart or upwards, and Quart well your Hand and Shoulder; but when a Thruſt is made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sword, then give it in with your Nails in Terce or downwards, and keep your Hilt much lower than your Point, and your Head as clear as may be from you Adverſaries Sword.</p>

                  <p>In theſe Rules there is great advantage; as in the Quarting of your Hand, when you Thruſt within, the Sword, preſerves them from your Adverſaries Counter-Temps Thruſts in the Face; ſo likewiſe does your Thruſting cloſe by the Feeble of the Sword, and keeping your Hilt lower than the Point, when you Thruſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sword, as alſo the holding of your Head to the contrary ſide your Adverſaries Sword is on, preſerve you from Counter-Temps, ever obſerving as a general Rule; to keep your Head on the contrary ſide of your Adverſaries Sword, on what ſide ſoever you Thruſt, for this will fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently preſerve your Face from being hit.</p>

                  <p>There is a difference between this and the ſingle Feint; for in the ſingle one you muſt make two Motions, <hi>viz.</hi> With the firſt you make your Feint, and with the next you give in your Thruſt, unleſs you make your Feint
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:109118:46"/>
on that ſide your Sword lyeth, which may be done without diſengaging, and is the ſimpleſt of all others in all ſingle Feints, it muſt be given in upon the ſide your Sword was before you made your Feint; But in the double Feint you are to make three Motions, and the Thruſt (unleſs when you make your firſt Motion on that ſide your Sword was preſented) is given in on the other ſide, and not on the ſide the Sword was juſt before you began to make your Feint; and to play this, there are two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> When you are within Meaſure, you muſt play it one way, and without Meaſure another way.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt, your Sword being preſented within your Adverſaries Sword, then diſengage and make your firſt Motion without his Sword, ſo ſtand a Thought on it to try whether he will anſwer you, by offering to proceed to the Parade; if he do not anſwer, it is uſeleſs, but if he do, then preſently make your ſecond Motion within his Sword, and your third Motion without it, by giving the Thruſt; both theſe Motion muſt be done with admirable quickneſs; at every Motion give a beat with your Foot, and diſengage; turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Nails in Quart.</p>
                  <p>If you are without diſtance, make a Motion to ſee if he will anſwer your Feint, and if he do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin again, make your firſt Motion, as within diſtance, approaching at the ſame time, and ſo your ſecond and third.</p>
                  <p>There is a contrary to theſe, that is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved when your Adverſary makes uſe of them againſt you, Then you muſt make uſe either of the Counter-caveating Parade, or keep your Sword Point immoveable towards his Face that oppoſes you, your Arm as much ſtretched out

as poſſible; and when you do ſo you muſt recover your Body, by drawing your Right-foot cloſe to your Left, ſtand as it were on Tip-toe, and if for all this your Adverſary give a home Thruſt, then you muſt Counter-temps him in the Face, and Parie his Thruſt with your Left-hand; or if you perceive him make variety of Feints, then upon every one of them make a half Thruſt, which will oblige him to betake himſelf to the Parade, and ſo when you pleaſe you may take the purſuit, or when he makes variety of Feints, give a plain home Thruſt, as ſmart as may be, and endeavour to defend your ſelf from Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-temps with your Left-hand, and to prevent them, it is always in this Caſe beſt when you give a Thruſt, to uſe your Left-hand.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Your <hi>Hawk</hi> watch, and keep from Sleep, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually carrying him upon your Fiſt, familiarly ſtroak him with a Wing or ſome Dead Fowl, or the like, and play with him; Accuſtom to gaze, and look in his Face with a Loving, Smiling, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Countenance; and that will make him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, and familiar with Men,</p>
               <p>Having made him familiar, the next thing is to <hi>Bring him to the Lure,</hi> (which the <hi>Faulconer</hi> makes of Feathers and Leather, much like a Fowl, which he caſts into the Air, and calls the <hi>Hawk</hi> to) which is after this manner. Set your <hi>Hawk</hi> on the Perch, unhood him and ſhew him ſome Meat within your Fiſt, call him by <hi>Chirping, Whiſtling,</hi> or the like, till he comes, then Feed him with it; if he comes not, let him Faſt, and be ſharp ſet: Short-winged <hi>Hawks,</hi> are properly ſaid to be called, not <hi>Lured.</hi> Make him bold, and acquainted with Men, Dogs, and Horſes, and let him be eager and ſharp-ſet, before you ſhew him the <hi>Lure,</hi> knowing his <hi>Luring</hi> Hours; and let both ſides of the <hi>Lure,</hi> be garniſhed with warm and bloody Meat; let him likewiſe know your Voice well; ſo that being well acquainted with Voice, and <hi>Lure,</hi> the Hearing of the one, or fight of the other, makes him Obedient; which you muſt reward by Feeding, or puniſh by Faſting.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:109118:50"/>
But before <hi>Luring</hi> (or any Flight) it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to Bathe your <hi>Hawk</hi> in ſome quiet and ſtill ſhallow Brook, or for want of that in a Large Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhallow Tub, or the like, leſt being at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, you loſe your <hi>Hawk,</hi> (whoſe Nature requires ſuch Bathing) and make him range. Now to make him know his <hi>Lure,</hi> is thus: Give your <hi>Hawk</hi> to another, and having looſned in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs his Hood-ſtrings, and faſtened a <hi>Pullet</hi> to the <hi>Lure,</hi> go a little diſtance, caſt it half the length of the ſtring about your Head, ſtill <hi>Luring</hi> with your Voice, unhood your <hi>Hawk,</hi> and throw it a little way from him; if he ſtoop and ſeize, let his plum the <hi>Pullet,</hi> and feed on it upon the <hi>Lure:</hi> Then take him and Meat on your Fiſt, Hood him and give him the Tiring of the Wing, or Foot of the ſaid <hi>Pullet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having Manned and <hi>Lured</hi> your <hi>Hawk</hi> before you bring him to his Flight, one thing is to be obſerved and done, called in the <hi>Faulconers Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, Enſeaming,</hi> which is to cleanſe him from Fat, Greaſe, and Glut, know by his round Thighs, and full Meutings; and thus you may do it: In the Morning when you feed him, give him a bit or two of Hot-meat, and at Night very little or nothing. Then feed him Morning and Evening with a <hi>Rook,</hi> waſh't twice till the Pinions be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; then give a Caſting of Feathers as his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will bear; and once in two or three dayes give him a Hens-neck well joynted and waſht: Then a quick Train <hi>Pigeon</hi> every Morning; and after by theſe and his own Exerciſe, he has broken and diſſolved the Greaſe, give him three or four <hi>Pellets</hi> of the Root of <hi>Sallandine,</hi> as big as a Garden Peaſe, ſteept in the Sirup of <hi>Roſes;</hi> and you have done this part of your Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:109118:51"/>To Enter your <hi>Hawks,</hi> for <hi>Partridge</hi> or Fowl, Lay an old Field <hi>Partridge</hi> in a Hole, covered with ſomething, and faſten to it a ſmall <hi>Creance (i. e.</hi> a Fine ſmall long Line of ſtrong and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wound Packthread faſtned to the <hi>Hawks</hi> Leaſh when firſt Lured,) and uncoupling your ranging Spaniels, pluck off the Covering of the Train <hi>Partridge</hi> and let it go, and the <hi>Hawk</hi> after it; and as ſoon as he has ſlain it, reward him well with it. And thus to make him fly at Fowl, feed him well with the Train of the Fowl you would have; doing afterwards as above.</p>
               <p>The Fault of <hi>Hawks</hi> differ according to their Nature and Make. Long-Winged <hi>Hawks</hi> faults are thus helped. If he uſed to take ſtand, flying at the River, or in Champain Fields, ſhun flying near Trees or Covert, or otherwiſe, let ſeveral Perſons have Trains, and as he offers to ſtand, let him that's next caſt out his Train, and he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it reward him. And indeed you ought never to be without ſome live Bird or Fowl in your Bag, as <hi>Pigeon, Duck, Mallard,</hi> &amp;c. If he be Froward and Coy; when he Kills, reward him not as uſually, but ſlide ſome other Meat under him and let him take his pleaſure on it; giving him ſome Feathers to make him ſcour and caſt. If he be <hi>Wild, look not inward,</hi> but mind Check, (<hi>i. e.</hi> other Game, as Crows, &amp;c. that fly croſs him) then lure him back, and ſtooping to it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him preſently.</p>
               <p>The faults of Short-winged <hi>Hawks</hi> thus are helped. Sometimes the <hi>Goſhawk</hi> and <hi>Sparrow-Hawks,</hi> will neither kill, nor fly the Game to Mark, but will turn Tail to it: Then encourage your Dogs to Hunt, caſt a Train <hi>Partridge</hi> before
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:109118:51"/>
your <hi>Hawk,</hi> make him ſeize it, and feed well up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>If a Hawk take a Tree, and will not fly at all, feed him then upon quick Birds, and make him foot them, and in the plain Champaign Fields un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood him, and riding up and down a while let one caſt out a Field <hi>Partridge</hi> before him, let him fly at it, and footing it, feed on it. If they be too fond of a Man, that after a ſtroke or two will not fly, be ſeldom familiar with him, and reward him not as he comes ſo improperly: Otherwiſe reward him well.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Mewing</hi> of <hi>Hawks,</hi> the beſt time for Long-winged <hi>Hawks</hi> is about the middle of <hi>April,</hi> and <hi>March</hi> for the Short-winged <hi>Hawks.</hi> There are two kinds of <hi>Mewings.</hi> 1. <hi>At the ſtock or ſtone;</hi> ſo called from its being low upon the Ground, free from Noiſe, Vermin or ill Air. 2. <hi>At large;</hi> ſo called from being in a high Room, with open Windows towards the <hi>North</hi> or <hi>North-East.</hi> The former is accounted the beſt <hi>Mew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> The Faulconer, before he <hi>Mews</hi> his <hi>Hawks,</hi> ſee if they have <hi>Lice,</hi> to Pepper and Scower them too. The beſt time to draw the Field <hi>Hawk</hi> from the <hi>Mew,</hi> is in <hi>June,</hi> and he will be ready to fly in <hi>August;</hi> the <hi>Hawks</hi> for the River in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> will be ready in <hi>September.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:109118:54"/>1. That as all <hi>Muſick</hi> conſiſts in theſe ſix plain <hi>Notes, La Sol Fa Mi Re <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t;</hi> ſo in <hi>Ringing,</hi> a Peal of Bells is Tuned according to theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Muſick: For as each <hi>Bell takes its Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from the Note it Sounds,</hi> by its being flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or deeper, as, <hi>Firſt,</hi> or Treble, <hi>ſecond, third, fourth,</hi> &amp;c. as they are in number to <hi>ten</hi> or <hi>twelve</hi> Bells, the laſt being called the <hi>Tenor;</hi> So muſt they ſucceſſively ſtrike one after another both <hi>Fore-ſtroke</hi> and <hi>Back-ſtroke,</hi> in a due Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical time or Equi-diſtance, to render their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony the more Pleaſant, and to make the Young Practitioner the better informed to obſerve the <hi>Life of Muſick,</hi> and indeed of true Ringing, <hi>Time;</hi> and therefore is called, <hi>Round-ringing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As in Muſick, ſo in Ringing there are three <hi>Concords,</hi> ſo called from their Melodious Harmony and Agreement, which Principally are theſe; <hi>Thirds, viz.</hi> 13, 24, <hi>&amp;c. Fifths</hi> 15, 26, <hi>&amp;c. Eights</hi> 18, 29, 310, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and theſe are the more pleaſant according to the Number of Bells they are ſtruck on, and as they are ſtruck, whether ſeperately or mutually. From hence <hi>Changes</hi> are made, which is only a Changing place of one <hi>Note</hi> with another, ſo variouſly, as Muſick may be heard a thouſand ways of Harmony; which being ſo obvious to common Obſervation, I ſhall not go about to demonſtrate; for that if two may be varied two ways, ſurely by the Rule of <hi>Multiplication,</hi> a Man may eaſily learn how many times 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 12 Bells Notes may be varied; which will run almoſt <hi>ad infinitum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. For the better obſerving the Ringing of <hi>Changes</hi> or <hi>Rounds,</hi> theſe three things are to be noted.</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:109118:55"/>
                  <item>1. <hi>The Raiſing true in Peal.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Ringing at a low Compaſs;</hi> and</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Ceaſing in true Peal;</hi> all which three are the moſt eſſential Parts to render a Practitioner <hi>Excellent.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. For <hi>Raſing a Peal of Bells true,</hi> the modern and beſt Practice recommends the <hi>ſwifteſt and quickeſt poſſible,</hi> every one taking Aſſiſtance to raiſe his Bell, as its going requires: the <hi>leſſer</hi> Bells as <hi>Treble, &amp;c.</hi> being by main ſtrength <hi>held down</hi> in their firſt Sway (or pull) to get time for the ſtriking of the reſt of larger Compaſs; and ſo continued to be ſtrong pulled till Frame-high, and then may be ſlackned: The bigger, as <hi>Tenor,</hi> &amp;c. muſt be pincht or checkt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, that the Notes may be hard to ſtrike round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and hanſomely. Obſerve that all the Notes ſtrike round at one Pull: I do not mean the firſt; but 'tis according to the Bigneſs and Weightineſs of your Bells: However in raiſing a Peal, do not let one Bell ſtrike before the reſt, or miſs when the reſt do; this is contrary to the Strict Rules of <hi>true Ringing:</hi> And this is called <hi>Round-ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Now if you deſign to raiſe a Peal of Bells for <hi>Changes,</hi> you ought to raiſe them to a Set-pull, as the moſt proper for commanding the Notes, and he who is not well skilled to manage his Bell at a Set-pull, will be apt to drop or overturn it, be in a Wood, and fruitleſsly toil and moil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Therefore in practiſing the Setting of a Bell, caſt your Eye about the other Bell-Ropes, during your managing your own, that you may accuſtom your ſelf to manage it according to the <hi>Change.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For <hi>Ringing at a low Compaſs,</hi> is thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: By keeping a due <hi>punctum</hi> or beat of time, in the ſucceſſive ſtriking one after another
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:109118:55"/>
of every Bell; the beſt Ringer being ſet to the <hi>Treble,</hi> that may guide and direct the reſt of the Notes in their due Meaſure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>For Ceaſing a Peal of Bells;</hi> let them fall gradually from a ſet Peal, checking them only at Sally, till the low Compaſs renders it uſeleſs; and when ſo low, that for want of Compaſs, they can ſcarce ſtrike at Back-ſtroak; then let the the <hi>Treble</hi>-Ringer ſtamp, as a Signal, to notify, that the next time they come to ſtrike at the Fore-ſtroke, to check them down, to hinder their ſtriking the Back-ſtroke; yet Fore-ſtroke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, till brought to a neat and graceful Chime, which may be the Finis to that Peal.</p>
               <p>Thus much in ſhort, for <hi>Raiſing, Round-ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>Ceaſing a Peal</hi> of Bells; I come next to lead you forth into that ſpacious Field of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of <hi>Changes,</hi> and preſent you with Inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions that may be meerly neceſſary, for the right Underſtanding the ſeveral kinds of them.</p>
               <p>Now in <hi>Ringing Changes,</hi> two of our beſt Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, are to be employed, <hi>viz.</hi> The Ear, and the Eye: The Ear, hearing when to make a <hi>Change;</hi> and the Eye directing the Bell in make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: The Bells being the Object of the Former, and the Bell-ropes the Object of the Latter: And to render both the Eye and Ear Uſeful in Ringing <hi>Changes,</hi> theſe Five things are throughly to be Underſtood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Endeavour to diſtinguiſh the <hi>Notes</hi> of a <hi>Peal</hi> of <hi>Bells,</hi> one from another while Ringing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Learn to apprehend the places of the <hi>Notes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly;</hi> How to make a <hi>Change</hi> in <hi>Ringing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:109118:56"/>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> How to Practiſe the four fore-going Notions, in General.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To know the Notes of a Peal of Bells aſunder</hi> (which is eaſy in <hi>Round-Ringing</hi>) in <hi>Changes</hi> is thus: Get the skill of Tuning them with your <hi>Voice,</hi> by imitating their Notes while <hi>Ringing.</hi> Or if you are acquainted, either by your ſelf or Friend, with ſome <hi>Singing-Maſter,</hi> or one who has skill in <hi>Singing,</hi> get him to inſtruct you in the true Pitch of any <hi>Note,</hi> and aid your diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing them; otherwiſe you may be puzzled in this, to know which is <hi>Treble,</hi> which <hi>Second,</hi> &amp;c. as in 532641, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To know the places of the <hi>Notes,</hi> is no way better to be apprehended than thus: The Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner ought to form an <hi>Idea</hi> in his Head of the place of each <hi>Note,</hi> whether in a direct <hi>Line,</hi> or <hi>Obliquely;</hi> and repreſenting them by a <hi>Figure</hi> in his Mind, ſee (as it were) by the Eye of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding each ſtroke of the <hi>Bell,</hi> as the <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> 1. <hi>Second</hi> 2. <hi>Third</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that as the <hi>Ear</hi> is to direct him, when to make the Change, ſo a right Apprehenſion of the <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Places</hi> of the <hi>Notes,</hi> ought to be a means to guide his Ear.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Precedency of <hi>Notes,</hi> is of a very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Demonſtration; thus: In Ringing <hi>Changes</hi> the Fore and Back-ſtroke, ſucceſſively following one another, are properly ſaid to <hi>Lye behind</hi> one another, according to their places of ſtriking. Or in ſhort, in 12345. the <hi>Note</hi> that leads either at Fore or Back-ſtroke, is ſaid to <hi>Lye before</hi> the reſt, and the laſt to be behind, As the 2 is ſaid to lye behind the 1, ſo it lyeth before the 3, as the 3 lyeth behind 2, ſo it lyeth before the 4. And ſo of as many as are <hi>Rung.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The manner of making a <hi>Change,</hi> is very
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:109118:56"/>
common, and needs no particular, but general Rule; That it is made by moving one <hi>Note</hi> into anothers place, Up and Down, as Occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; but uſually made by two <hi>Notes</hi> ſtanding one next the other, as hereafter may be obſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> In your Ringing <hi>Changes,</hi> theſe two things (in which conſiſts the practick part of this Art) are to be rightly conſidered, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Readily to know which two <hi>Bells</hi> are to make the ſucceeding <hi>Change.</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> to conſider (if you are concerned in it) what <hi>Bell</hi> you are to follow in making it. To underſtand which the more perfectly, you muſt imprint in your Memory, the Method of the <hi>Changes</hi> prick'd in <hi>Figures,</hi> and to be expert likewiſe in ſetting them down divers ways, and making any <hi>Figure</hi> a <hi>Hunt</hi> at Pleaſure; and thus without pauſing or heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to conſider the Courſe, you may throughly underſtand the Methods; the Four preceding Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations being firſt perfectly underſtood</p>
               <p>There are two ways of <hi>Ringing Changes,</hi> viz. By <hi>Walking</hi> them, as the Artiſts ſtile it; or by <hi>Whole Pulls,</hi> or <hi>Half-pulls: Walking</hi> is, when in one <hi>Change</hi> the <hi>Bells</hi> go round, <hi>Four, Six,</hi> or <hi>Eight</hi> times; which is a moſt incomparable way to improve a Young Practitioner, by giving him time to conſider, which two <hi>Bells</hi> do make the next ſucceeding <hi>Change,</hi> and in making it, what <hi>Bell</hi> each is to follow; ſo that by this means (by his Induſtry) he may be capable of Ringing at <hi>Whole-pulls;</hi> which is, when the <hi>Bells</hi> go round in a <hi>Change</hi> at Fore and Back-ſtroke; and a New <hi>Change</hi> is made every time they are pulled down at Sally: This was an Ancient Practice, but is now laid aſide, ſince we have learnt a more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way of hanging our <hi>Bells,</hi> that we can man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age

               <p>He that Rings the ſloweſt <hi>Hunt,</hi> ought to notify the <hi>extream Changes;</hi> which is, when the Leading <hi>Bell</hi> is pulling down, that he might make the <hi>Change</hi> next before the extreme, he ought to ſay, <hi>Extreme.</hi> By this means, betwixt the Warning and the Extreme there will be one compleat <hi>Change.</hi>

                  <p>There are <hi>two kinds of Changes,</hi> viz. <hi>Plain Changes,</hi> and <hi>Croſs-peals;</hi> which Terms do denote the <hi>Nature</hi> of them; for as the firſt is ſtiled <hi>Plain,</hi> ſo are its methods eaſy; and as the ſecond is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Croſs,</hi> ſo are its Methods croſs and intricate: The firſt have a general Method, in which all the Notes (except Three) have a direct <hi>Hunting-Courſe,</hi> moving gradually under each other, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and uniformly: <hi>Plain</hi> are likwiſe termed <hi>ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le Changes,</hi> becauſe there is but one ſingle Change made in the ſtriking all the Notes round, either at Fore or Back-ſtroke. But the Second is <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> each <hi>Peal</hi> differing in its Courſe from all others; and in <hi>Croſs-peals as many Changes may be made as the Notes will permit.</hi> In ſhort, as to <hi>Plain-changes,</hi> I ſhall not dilate on them here, it being ſo <hi>plainly</hi> underſtood by every one that lately have rung a <hi>Bell</hi> in peal; all therefore I ſhall add is this, that any two Notes that ſtrike next together may make a Change, which may be done either <hi>ſingle or double,</hi> as you liſt. The <hi>ſingle,</hi> by changing two Notes; and the <hi>double,</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:109118:57"/>
by changing Four, <hi>i. e.</hi> Two to make one Change and two another; which is however called <hi>One double Change,</hi> and not two Changes; becauſe tis made in ſtriking the Notes of the <hi>Bells</hi> once round.</p>

                  <p>Or in theſe <hi>Croſs-peals</hi> we muſt Obſerve the <hi>prime Movement,</hi> which ſets the whole Frame a going, and that is called the <hi>Hunt,</hi> which hath <hi>one conſtant <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niform Motion throughout the Peal,</hi> and different from that of the other Notes; and indeed by this the whole Courſe of the Peal is Steered. This keeps a continual motion through the other Notes, <hi>i. e.</hi> from leading, to ſtrike behind, and from thence again to Lead; which is called one <hi>compleat Courſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some Peals upon <hi>five Bells</hi> conſiſt of ſingle Courſes, wherein are ten Changes, and twelve Courſes make the Peal. Others upon five, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of double Courſes, wherein are twenty Changes to every Courſe, and ſix Courſes in the Peal.</p>
                  <p>Upon <hi>ſix Bells</hi> there are likewiſe <hi>ſingle</hi> and <hi>double</hi> Courſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Twelve Changes in every ſingle Courſe, as in <hi>Grandſire-bob, &amp;c.</hi> and Twenty-four Changes in every double Courſe, as in <hi>College Bobs,</hi> that being the firſt Change of every Courſe, wherein the <hi>Hunt</hi> leaves Leading: In ſhort, judiciouſly obſerve the firſt Courſe of any <hi>Croſs-peal,</hi> and you will ſoon ſee the general Method of the whole Peal: All Courſes in Croſs-Peals agreeing in theſe following three Reſpects. Firſt, <hi>In the Motion of the Hunt.</hi> Secondly <hi>In the motion of the reſt of the Notes:</hi> And Thirdly, <hi>In making the Changes.</hi> Which three things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well (to omit Inſtance of Demonſtration)
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:109118:58"/>
and narrowly obſerved, will be very helpful both in pricking and ringing Courſes; the firſt and third for directing you in Pricking them, and the firſt and ſecond in Ringing them.</p>
                  <p>There is one Difficulty to be removed e're I can come to prick down thoſe Peals I deſign to be the Subject of the Diſcourſe of this <hi>Epitome,</hi> and that is, <hi>How to make the firſt Changes at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of each Peal;</hi> I mean to make the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Third, Fourth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>whole Hunts;</hi> and this in ſhort is thus directed: In any <hi>Croſs-peal</hi> the <hi>whole Hunt</hi> may move either up or down at the beginning; and the Motion of the <hi>whole Hunt,</hi> in the firſt Courſe of each of the following Peals will direct the firſt Motion of any <hi>Croſs-Hunt,</hi> and by Conſequence of making the firſt Changes in that Peal. Taking along with you this Obſervation.</p>
                  <p>That whenſoever the firſt Change of any Peal happens to be <hi>ſingle,</hi> it muſt be made at the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroke, to prevent <hi>cutting Compaſs;</hi> and the like when a double Change happens firſt in a Peal of <hi>Triples and doubles:</hi> But when it happens, that the firſt Change is made at the Back-ſtroke, then Conſequently the Bells at the end of the Peal will come round at a Fore-ſtroke Change.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall omit ſpeaking to any of the ſeveral Peals on <hi>four or five Bells;</hi> for that in my opinion little <hi>Muſick</hi> is heard, though much <hi>Practical Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is made, from them; and therefore ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with <hi>Grandſire-bob,</hi> as having mentioned it but juſt before in my general View I made of <hi>Croſs-peals.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Treble</hi> is the whole <hi>Hunt,</hi> as in the former, and leads four times, and lyeth behind as many, and twice in every other place; the two <hi>Bells</hi> in the 3d. and 4th. places continue dodging, when the <hi>Treble</hi> moves out of 4th. place, until it comes down there again, and then the two hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dodge, till the <hi>Treble</hi> diſplaceth them; who maketh every double <hi>Change,</hi> except when it lieth behind, and then the double is on the four firſt, and on the four laſt when it leads. Every ſingle (except when the <hi>Treble</hi> lies there) is in the 5th. and 6th. places; or if poſſeſſed by the <hi>Treble,</hi> then in the 3d. and 4th. places: Every <hi>Bell</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Treble</hi>) lies four times in the Second place: But enough; a word is enough to the Wiſe.

               <p>There are to make up a Muſical Harmony computed ſeven Notes; now in the eaſieſt way expreſſed by the Seven letters of the Alphbet, <hi>viz. A. B. C. D. E. F.

Nature alike, is called by the name of that to which it is an Eighth; however above or below it; and for the better underſtanding the various Muſical Compoſitions out of theſe Notes, Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians have deviſed and make uſe of Lines and Characters, that as a Language, they may be underſtood and Communicated by Book, for the Inſtruction of the unlearned: As in the following Introductory Example, you will perceive;</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>In this example, before I come nearer to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars in general, obſerve firſt, that thoſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters you obſerve at the beginning of the Lines, are termed Cliffs or Claves, Keys to open and ſignify what part or pitch of Voice, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Treble, Mean,</hi> or <hi>Baſſe</hi> properly the Notes belong to; as likewiſe on what Line or Space the Seven letters expreſſing the Notes is placed. And then again, the five Lines and Spaces between them are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as Steps or Gradations whereon the degrees of Sound are to be expreſſed, or the Notes aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſcending: Then Thirdly, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters placed on the five Lines, expreſs the Notes them ſelves, or ſtand for them; and their difference in form, ſignify their quality, whether they be longer or ſhorter.</p>
               <p>Your care muſt therefore be in this, and the Chapters following, to conſider well in the firſt place, the <hi>Gam-ut,</hi> to learn the uſe of the Cliffs:
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:109118:69"/>
Next to that, the Names of the Lines and Spaces, whereby you may readily know how to call a Note, as it ſtands on any of the Lines; and Thirdly, How you ſhould Sing thoſe Notes in right Tune, as well by degrees, as leaps; and laſt of all, to give each Note its due Quantity of Time.</p>
               <p>This in general, being obſerved, and ſeriouſly weighed; that you may take a proſpect of your task, I from it proceed to the <hi>Gam-ut,</hi> ſo far as I think neceſſary to my preſent deſign, which is to let you underſtand by it the uſe of the Cliffs, with the order and diſtances of the Notes, as the Parts in a Body lye together.</p>
               <figure>
                  <head>The Gam<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ut or Scale of MUSIC</head>
               </figure>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:109118:69"/>The conſiſtence of this Scale is of Eleven Lines, with the Intermediate Spaces, and contains the places of all the Notes that are made uſe of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily in Vocal Muſick. In the firſt Column you will find placed the Old Notes, being ſet down, that you may ſee what they are. And in the Second Column you are ſhewed which of the Seven letters properly belongs to each Line and Space. The Third Column contains the Cliffs, or ſigned Keys, domonſtrating how many degrees of Notes they are one above another, which once Circumſpectly obſerved and known, the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Diſtance are with more eaſe computed. And here</p>
               <p>Five of theſe Lines, with their Spaces, are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſufficient for the pricking down any Tune, for which reaſon this Scale is divided into Three Parts or Staves, compaſsed in with Arched Lines; and of theſe the lowermoſt five are proper and belonging to the <hi>Baſs,</hi> and are known by this mark 𝆸 on the Line of <hi>F.</hi> uſually, therefore called the <hi>F. 𝄢 Fa-ut</hi> Cliff or Key; becauſe it opens to us the letters ſtanding on the other Lines and Spaces, as in the enſuing Chapter will appear. As for the upermoſt five Lines, they contain the higheſt of the Notes, and ſo belong to the Treble or higheſt Part. —The Key to which is marked in this manner, 𝄞 and ſometimes <hi>G S.</hi> on the lower Line but one.</p>
               <p>The middle part or Tenor, uſually takes in two of the upper Treble Lines; alſo two of the Baſs Lines, that in the middle only being proper to it ſelf, known by this mark placed on it, 𝄡 for the Cliff or Key, its place being properly in the middle Line, however it is many times placed on one or other of the other Lines; and note which ever the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:109118:70"/>
Cliff ſtands on, that Line is the place of <hi>C.</hi> and accordingly the other Lines are to be reckoned: Sometimes likewiſe we find the <hi>Baſs Cliff</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to the middle Line, and upon ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, that Line is <hi>F, &amp;c.</hi> and tho' this manner of Shifting the <hi>Cliff</hi> is troubleſome, yet Cuſtom and Practice having made the knowing of them neceſſary, you ought to be very well underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the manner of them, if you would be well skilled in Vocal or Inſtrumental Muſick.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Names of the Lines and Spaces.</head>
                  <p>Having thus far plainly proceeded to Introduce the beginner or learner, I now lead a ſtep further to the Names of the Lines and Spaces, which is a thing very Materal in the begining of learning. For in the <hi>Gam-ut</hi> having ſeen how the Notes lye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a Body, it will be proper to know how you muſt take them into parts according to the ſeveral Cliffs, which are three in number, three beginning uſually, as moſt common with the uppermoſt. And in theſe your firſt care will be to learn the Names of the Lines and Spaces, which are opened to you by the Cliff or Key; and theſe are in number Seven, expreſſed in the Seven letters, <hi>A. B. C. D. E. F. G.</hi> which for a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Sounds ſake, and other reaſons to be given, you muſt pronounce or call <hi>La, B, Ce, D, Lae, Fâ, G.</hi> and this <hi>Fa</hi> muſt be pronounced broad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe and the like Names the Notes receive for two Reaſons; the firſt is, becauſe the Voice is beſt ſent forth in expreſſing ſome Syllable; as likewiſe that this number of Notes might be known by as many diſtinct Names, as for their places in the Cliffs: See the Plate following.</p>

                  <p>And it will be very neceſſary, that you ſhould begin with and keep to one <hi>Cliff</hi> at the firſt, as it pleaſes you to chuſe, or as either of the three beſt agrees with your Voice for a high or low Pitch.</p>
                  <p>Having gone through all the Rules, and being perfect in that, then it is fit you ſhould proceed to the other. There is no need you ſhould med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle or trouble your ſelf with the <hi>Tenor</hi> or <hi>C Cliff</hi> becauſe it keeps no certain place; you muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve however, before you go further, to be ready at naming the Lines and Spaces, ſo readily
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:109118:71"/>
to tell, as ſoon as you look on them, what letter any Line or Space is called or named by.</p>
                  <p>As for the reſt, the <hi>Cliff</hi> leads you to them, for begining there, and Aſcending, you will find the letters lying in Order, and in deſcending; it is only your naming them backwards.</p>
                  <p>The daſh Lines, which you perceive above and below, are added only when the Notes Aſcend above the <hi>Staff,</hi> or deſcend below it.</p>

                  <p>The propereſt and moſt eaſy way for Tuning your Notes rightly, muſt be conſidered either in following the Voice of one skilled in Muſick, or Singing, or ſome ſuch Tuned Inſtrument, as is accomodated with Frets or Keys, which are the readeſt and only ways as yet made uſe of by Practitioners. That of a Maſter being moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, but where none of theſe can be had by the party deſirous to Learn, I ſhall lay down the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Directions, which will very much Inſtruct one that hath a Muſical Ear, eſpecially ſuch a one as has heard, and can Sing the Notes of the Six Bells, of which, I preſume, there are few, whoſe Genius Leads them to the Science of Muſick, are Ignorant.</p>
                  <p>Let me put then, Suppoſing that you can Sing, <hi>One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six,</hi> right; then ſhall I by the help of theſe Notes, proceed to ſet you further in the right, and lead you to all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Conſider well then, that beginning to Sing the firſt Note, let it ſtand on what Line or Space it will, you may Sing it with what Tune you think fit, either high or low, (as to the pitch of your Voice) but with this caution, that you reckon how many Notes you have above or below it, that your Voice in its pitch may be ſo managed as to reach them both without Squeaking or Grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, or any harſh or rough Indecency of Sound.</p>

               <head>Of COCK-FIGHTING.</head>
               <p>HErein let us firſt obſerve the choice of a <hi>Cock</hi> of the Game, directed by theſe four Characters following: That he be</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of a ſtrong <hi>Shape,</hi> proud and upright, and for this the <hi>Middle-ſized,</hi> neither too ſmall or too large, is beſt, becauſe moſt matchable, ſtrong and nimble. His <hi>Head</hi> ſmall like a <hi>Sparrow-Hawks;</hi> his <hi>Eye</hi> large and quick; <hi>Back</hi> ſtrong crook't at the ſetting on, and coloured as the Plume of his Feathers; the <hi>Beam of his Leg</hi> very ſtrong, and colour'd as his Plume; <hi>Spurs</hi> long, rough, and ſharp, hooking inward.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:109118:76"/>2. Of a good <hi>Colour,</hi> and herein the Gray, Yellow, or Red Pyle, with a black Breaſt, are to be preferred; the Pyde rarely good, and the White and Dun never. A Scarlet Head is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of Courage, but a Pale and wan of Faintneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Of <hi>Courage true,</hi> which you ſhall obſerve by his proud, ſtately, upright ſtanding and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and his frequent Crowing in his Pen.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Of a ſharp and ready Heel,</hi> which (in the Opinion of the beſt <hi>Cock-maſters,</hi>) of high Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; a <hi>Sharp-heel'd Cock, tho' ſomewhat falſe, is better</hi> (as diſpatching his buſineſs ſooneſt) <hi>than a true Cock with a dull Heel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For Breeding,</hi> the Beſt ſeaſon is from the Moon's encreaſe in <hi>February,</hi> to her encreaſe in <hi>March.</hi> The <hi>March</hi> Bird is beſt. And now firſt get a <hi>perfect Cock, to a perfect Hen,</hi> as the beſt Breeding, and ſee the <hi>Hen</hi> be of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Complexion <hi>(i. e.)</hi> rightly plumed, as black, brown, ſpeckt, grey, griſſel, or yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh; tufted on her Crown, large bodied, well poked, and having Weapons, are Demonſtrations of Excellency and Courage. Obſerve further her Comportment, if Friendly to her Chickens, and revengeful of Jnjuries from other Hens.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Cock</hi> and <hi>Hen-Chickins,</hi> (going till now promiſcuouſly one with another) begin to quarrel and peck each other, part them and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate their Walks: And the beſt for a Fighting Cock, are private and undiſturbed Walks, as, <hi>Wind-mills, Water-mills, Grange-houſes, Park-lodges,</hi> &amp;c. and their <hi>Feeding-place</hi> on ſoft Ground, or Boards; and have for his meet, <hi>white Corn,</hi> or <hi>White-bread Toſts,</hi> ſteept in Drink, or Urine, is good, both to Scower, and Cool them.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:109118:77"/>
And do not debilitate and debauch his Courage and Strength, by having too many <hi>Hens</hi> to walk with; three <hi>Hens</hi> are enough for one <hi>Cock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If before they be ſix Months Old, any of your <hi>Chickens Crow</hi> clear and loud, and unſeaſonable, then to the Pot or Spit with them, they are Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards; the true <hi>Cock</hi> is long ere he gets his Voice, and when he has gotten it, keeps good and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Time in Crowing.</p>
               <p>Next obſerve your <hi>Rooſting Perch,</hi> for this makes or marrs a <hi>Cock;</hi> for forming of which, conſult the beſt <hi>Cock-maſters</hi> Feeding pens, and the Perches there, and accordingly proportion your own; take care that the Ground underneath the Perch be ſoft, for if it be rough and hard, in leaping down he will hurt his Feet, and make them Gouty and Knotty.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Dieting,</hi> and <hi>Ordering</hi> of your <hi>Cock</hi> for Battle, obſerve theſe Rules. Let your <hi>Cock</hi> be full two years Old, then in the latter end of <hi>August,</hi> take up and Pen him, (it being now <hi>Cocking-time</hi> till the end of <hi>May</hi>) and ſee that he be ſound, hard feather,d, and full ſummed.</p>
               <p>The firſt four days after Penning, Feed him with the Crumb of Old <hi>Manchet</hi> cut into ſquare bits, thrice a day, and with the Coldeſt, and Sweeteſt Spring-water that can be had. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you think by this time he is throughly purged of his <hi>Corn, Worms, Gravel,</hi> and other courſe Feeding, take him in the Morning out of the Pen, and let him <hi>Sparr</hi> with another <hi>Cock</hi> ſome time to heat and chafe their Bodies, break Fat and Glut, and fit them for Purgation; firſt having covered their Spurs with Hots of Leather, to hinder their Wounding and drawing Blood of one another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:109118:77"/>After they have ſufficiently <hi>Sparred,</hi> that they pant again, take them up, and remove their Hots, and prepare them for a Sweating Bout thus: Take <hi>Butter,</hi> and <hi>Roſemary,</hi> finely chopt, and <hi>White-ſugar-candy,</hi> mixt together; and give them the quantity of a <hi>Wallnut;</hi> which will Scower, ſtrengthen; and prolong Breath: Then having (purpoſely) deep <hi>Straw Baskets,</hi> fill them half way with <hi>Straw,</hi> put in your <hi>Cock,</hi> and cover him with <hi>Straw</hi> to the top; lay the lid cloſe, and let him ſtove till the Evening. At Five a Clock take him out, and lick his Head and Eyes with your Tongue, then Pen him, and fill his Trough with <hi>Manchet</hi> and hot <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, take a Gallon of <hi>Wheat,</hi> and <hi>Oat-meal-flower,</hi> and with <hi>Ale,</hi> half a ſcore <hi>Whites</hi> of <hi>Eggs,</hi> and <hi>Butter,</hi> work it into a ſtiff <hi>Paſt;</hi> bake it into broad <hi>Cakes,</hi> and when four days Old, cut it into ſquare Bits.</p>
               <p>The Second day after <hi>Sparring,</hi> bring your <hi>Cock</hi> into a Green-cloſe, and ſhew him in your Arms a <hi>Dung-hill-cock,</hi> then run from him, and allure him thus to follow, ſuffering him now and then to ſtrike the <hi>Dung-hill-Cock,</hi> and ſo Chaſe him up and down for half an Hour, till he pants again; and thus Heated, carry him home, and ſcour him with half a Pound of <hi>Freſh-butter,</hi> beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with the Leaves of the <hi>Herb</hi> of <hi>Grace, Hyſop,</hi> and <hi>Roſemary,</hi> to the conſiſtence of a <hi>Salve,</hi> and give him the quantity of a <hi>Wallnut;</hi> then <hi>Stove,</hi> and <hi>Feed</hi> him as above. And thus for the firſt Fortnight, Spar or Chaſe him every other day.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Fortnight, twice a Week will be enough to Chaſe or Spar your <hi>Cock:</hi> Obſerving that you Stove and Scour him, proportionable to his Heating.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:109118:78"/>The third and laſt Fortnight (for ſix Weeks is long enough) feed him as before, but do not Spar him, but Chaſe him moderately twice, or thrice, as before; then roll his aforeſaid ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in <hi>Brown-ſugar-candy,</hi> to prevent his being Sick; reſt him four days, and then to the Pit.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, Match your Cock carefully, or what you have hitherto done, is nothing. And here obſerve the Length, and Strength of Cocks. The Length is thus known: Gripe the Cock by the Waſte, and make him ſhoot out his Legs, and in this Poſture compare, <hi>And have your Judgment about you.</hi> The Strength is known by this Maxim, <hi>The largeſt in the Garth, is the Strongeſt Cock.</hi> The Dimenſion of the <hi>Carth,</hi> is thus known: Gripe the <hi>Cock</hi> about from the joynts of your Thumb, to the Points of your great Finger, and you will find the Diſadvantage, <hi>The weak long Cock is the quickeſt eaſier Riſer, and the ſhort ſtrong one, the ſureſt Striker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus being well Matcht, accoutre him for the Pit. Clip his <hi>Main</hi> off cloſe to his Neck, from his head to his ſhoulders. Clip his Tail cloſe to his Rump, the Redder it appears the better. His wings ſloping, with ſharp Points; ſcrape ſmooth, and ſharpen his Spurs; leave no feathers on his Crown; then moiſten his head with Spittle.</p>
               <p>The Battle done, ſearch and ſuck your Cocks wounds, and waſh them well with hot <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> then give him a Roll of your beſt Scouring, and ſtove him for that Night. If he be ſwelled, the next morning, ſuck and bathe his Wounds again, and pounce them with the Powder of the Herb <hi>Robert,</hi> through a fine Bag; give him an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of Bread in warm <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> and ſtove him, till the ſwelling be down. If he be hurt in his Eye,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:109118:78"/>
chew a little ground <hi>Jvy,</hi> and Spit the Juice in it; which is good for <hi>Films, Haws, Warts,</hi> &amp;c. Or if he hath <hi>veined</hi> himſelf in his ſight, by nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſtriking, or other croſs blows, when you have found the hurt, bind the ſoft Down of Hair to it, will cure it.</p>
               <p>When you viſit your wounded <hi>Cocks,</hi> a month or two after you have put them to their Walks, if you find about their heads any ſwollen Bunches, hard and blackiſh at one end, then there are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Cores undoubtedly in them; therefore open them, and with your Thumb cruſh them out, ſuck out the Corruption, and fill the holes with freſh Butter; and that will infallibly cure them.</p>

                  <head>Cures for Diſtempers incident to the Cock or Chick of the Game.</head>

               <p>By this time he is a Year old, now (the ſeaſon fit) into the Field, and let him range, [obedient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.] If he wantonly babble or cauſeleſly open, correct him by biting ſoundly the Roots of his Ears, or Laſhing.

                  <p>For taking the firſt (I mean the greater Fowl) with Nets, obſerve in general this: Come two hours before their feeding hours, Morning and Evening; and Spreading your Net on the Ground ſmooth and flat, ſtake the two lower ends firm, and let the upper ends be extended on the long Cord; of which the further end muſt be faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Ground, three Fathoms from the Net, the Stake in a direct Line with the lower Verge of the Net; the other, ten or twelve fathom long, have in your hand at the aforſaid diſtance, and get ſome ſhelter of Art or Nature, to keep you from the curious and ſhy Eye of the Game; having your Net ſo ready that the leaſt pull may do your work, ſtrew'd over with Graſs as it lies to hide it: A live <hi>Hern,</hi> or ſome other Fowl lately taken, according to what you ſeek for, will be very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for a Stale. And you will have ſport from the Dawning, till the Sun is about an hour high; but no longer; and from Sun-ſet till Twilight; theſe being their feeding times.</p>
                  <p>For the ſmall (Water) Fowl. Obſerve the Evening is beſt before Sun ſet. Stake down your Nets on each ſide the River half a foot within the Water, the lower part ſo plumb'd as to ſink no further; the upper Slantwiſe ſhoaling againſt, but not touching by two foot, the water, and the Strings which bear up this upper ſide faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſmall yielding ſticks prickt in the Bank, that as the Fowl ſtrike may ply to the Nets to intangle them. And thus lay your Nets (as many as you pleaſe) about twelve ſcore one from another, as the River or Brook will afford. And doubt not your ſucceſs. To expedite it however,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:109118:81"/>
a Gun Fired three or four times in the Fens and Plaſhes, a good diſtance from your Nets, will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright and Poſt them to your Snares; and ſo do at the Rivers, when you lay in the Fens.</p>
                  <p>Winter time is the moſt proper for taking all manner of Small Birds, as flocking then promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuoſly together, <hi>Larks, Lennets, Chaffinchee, Goldfinches, Yellow-Hammers,</hi> &amp;c. with this <hi>Bird-lime,</hi> Put to a quarter of a Pound of <hi>Bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime,</hi> an ounce of freſh <hi>Lard,</hi> or <hi>Capons-greaſe,</hi> and let it gently melt together over the Fire, but not Boyl; then take a quantitiy of <hi>Wheat-ears,</hi> as you think your uſe ſhall require, and cut the ſtraw about a foot long beſides the Ears, and from the Ear lime the ſtraw ſix Inches; the warmer it is, the leſs diſcernible it will be. Then to the Field adjacent, carrying a bag of Chaff, and threſh'd Ears, ſcatter them twenty Yards wide, and ſtick the lim'd ears (declining downwards) here, and there; Then traverſe the Fields, diſturb their Haunts, and they wili repair to your Snare, and pecking at the Ears, finding they ſtick to them, mount; and the Lim'd ſtraws, lapping under their Wings, dead their flight, they cannot be diſengaged, but fall and be taken they muſt. Do not go near them, till they riſe of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and let not five or ſix entangled lead you to Spoil your Game, and incur the loſs of Five or Six dozen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lime-Twigs,</hi> is another Expedient for taking of great Fowl, being Rods that are long, ſmall, ſtrait, and pliable, the upper part apt to play to and fro) being beſmeared with <hi>Bird-lime</hi> warm. Thus to be uſed, Obſerve the Haunts of the Fowl, have a Stale, (a living Fowl of the ſame kind you would take) and croſs pricking your Rods,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:109118:82"/>
one into, and another againſt the Wind ſloping, a foot diſtant one from the other; pin down you Stale, ſome diſtance from them, tying ſome ſmall ſtring to him, to pull and make him flutter to allure the Fowl down. If any be caught, do not run preſently upon them, their fluttering will encreaſe your Game. A well taught <hi>Spaniel</hi> is not amiſs to retake thoſe that are entangled, and yet flutter away. Thus likewiſe for the Water, conſult the Rivers depth, and let your Rods be proportionable; what is Lim'd of them being above the Water, and a <hi>Mallard,</hi> &amp;c. as a Stale placed here and there, as aforeſaid. You need not wait on them, but three times a day viſit them, and ſee your Game; if you miſs any Rods (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore know their Number) ſome Fowl entangled is got away with it, into ſome Hole, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and here your <hi>Spaniel</hi> will be ſerviceable to find him.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Small-birds,</hi> a <hi>Lime-buſh</hi> is beſt; thus, Cut down a great Bough of a <hi>Birch,</hi> or <hi>Willow-tree,</hi> trim it clean, and Lime it handſomely, within four Fingers of the bottom: Place this Buſh ſo ordered, in ſome quick-ſet, or dead <hi>Hedge,</hi> in Spring time: In Harveſt, or Summer, in <hi>Groves, Buſhes, Hedges, Fruit-trees, Flax,</hi> and <hi>Hemp</hi>-Lands: In Winter, about <hi>Houſes, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velle, Barns, Stacks,</hi> &amp;c. A <hi>Bird-call</hi> is here alſo neceſſary, or your own induſtrious skill in the Notes of ſeveral Birds.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe Gentlemen who have Fiſh-ponds, wonder they loſe ſo many Fiſh, and are apt to Cenſure ſometimes undeſervedly their Neighbours, when it is the inſatiable <hi>Hern,</hi> that is the true cauſe: I ſhall next lay down the beſt and moſt approved way of taking the great Fiſh-devouring <hi>Hern,</hi> whoſe Haunt having found, obſerve this
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:109118:82"/>
Method to take him. Get three or four ſmall <hi>Roaches,</hi> or <hi>Dace,</hi> take a ſtrong Hook, (not too rank) with Wyre to it, and draw the Wyre juſt within the skin, from the ſide of the Gills, to the Tail of the ſaid Fiſh, and he will live four or five days, (If dead the <hi>Hern</hi> will not touch it.) Then have a ſtrong Line, of a dark Green-ſilk, twiſted with Wyre, about three Yards long, tie a round ſtone of a pound to it, and lay three or four ſuch hooks, but not too deep in the Water, out of the <hi>Herns</hi> wading; and two or three Nights will anſwer your Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <head>The ſeveral wayes of taking <hi>Pheaſants.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>You muſt learn and underſtand the ſeveral Notes of a Natural <hi>Pheaſant-Call,</hi> and how uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to apply them. In the Morning juſt before or at <hi>Sun-riſing,</hi> call them to feed, and ſo at <hi>Sun-ſetting:</hi> In the Fornoon, and Afternoon, your Note muſt be to Cluck them together to Brood, or to chide them for ſtraggling, or to notify ſome danger at hand.</p>
                  <p>Thus skilled in their Notes; and by the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Solitaryneſs, and ſtrong undergrowth of the place aſſured of their Haunts, cloſely lodge your ſelf, and ſoftly at firſt call; leſt being near you, a loud Note affright them; and no Reply made, raiſe your Note gradually, to the higheſt; and if there be a <hi>Pheaſant</hi> in hearing, he will anſwer you, in as loud a Note. Be ſure it be Tunable. As ſoon as you are anſwered, creep nearer to it; if far off, and a ſingle Fowl, as you call, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, ſo will the <hi>Pheaſant.</hi> Having gotten ſight of her, on the Ground, or Perch, ceaſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and with all ſilence poſſible, ſpread your
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:109118:83"/>
Net conveniently, between the <hi>Pheaſant,</hi> and you, one end of the Net faſtned to the Ground, and the other end, hold by a long Line in your hand, by which you may pull it together, if ſtrained; then call again, and as you ſee the <hi>Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant</hi> come under your Net, riſe and ſhew your ſelf, and affrighting her, ſhe will mount, and ſo is taken. Thus if on the contrary you have divers Anſwers, from ſeveral <hi>Corners,</hi> of the <hi>Coppice,</hi> and you keep your place and not ſtir, they will come to your Call, and then having a pair of Nets, ſpread one on each ſide, and do as before. Your Nets, muſt be made of Green or Black double-twin'd Thread, the Meſh about an inch ſquare, between Knot, and Knot, the whole Net about three Fathom long, and Seven foot broad, verged with ſtrong ſmall Cord on each ſide and ends, to lye hollow and compaſs-wiſe.</p>
                  <p>The next way of taking <hi>Pheaſant-Powts,</hi> is by Driving, thus. Having found the Haunt of an <hi>Eye of Pheaſants,</hi> known by the <hi>Barrenneſs</hi> of the Place, <hi>Mutings</hi> and looſe Feathers, then in the little Pads and Wayes, like Sheep tracks, they have made, place your Nets (taking the Wind with you) a-croſs theſe Paths hollow, looſe and circularly, the nether part fixt to the Ground, and the upper ſide hollow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as aforeſaid: Then to their Haunt, and there call them together, if ſcattered; then with a Driver, an Inſtrument like that of <hi>Cloath-dreſſers,</hi> rake gently the Buſhes and Boughs about you, the <hi>Powts</hi> will run, and ſtop and liſten; then give another rake, and ſo you will drive them like ſheep into your Nets: Obſerve in this <hi>Secrecy, Time</hi> and <hi>Leiſure,</hi> or you ſpoil your Sport; <hi>Secrecy</hi> in concealing your ſelf from being ſeen by them; and <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Leiſure,</hi> by not being too haſty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:109118:83"/>Laſtly for taking <hi>Pheaſants</hi> with the <hi>Lime-Buſh,</hi> or Rods, order theſe, as I have before preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; your Rods about twelve inches long, and your Buſh containing not above eight Twigs, with a pretty long Handle, ſharpned to ſtick in the Ground, or Buſhes, Shrubs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and let it be planted as near the <hi>Pheaſants pearching Branch,</hi> as may be. Place your Rods on the Ground, near the Buſh; for when ſome are taken below by they Rods, the will ſcare up the others to get on the Buſhes to ſeek what's become of their Fellows, and there become your Prey themſelves.</p>

                  <head>For taking Partridge.</head>
                  <p>You muſt firſt find the <hi>Partridges</hi> Haunt. Which is moſtly in ſtanding Corn-Fields, where they breed; as likewiſe in Stubble after the Corn is out, eſpecially Wheat-ſtubble till it is trodden, and then they repair to Barley-ſtubble, if freſh; and the Furrows amongſt the Clots, Brambles and long Graſs, are ſometimes their lurking places, for Twenty and upward in a Covy. In the Winter in up-land Meadows, in the dead Graſs or Fog under Hedges, among Mole-hills; or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Roots of Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Various and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain are their Haunts. And tho' ſome by the Eye, by diſtinguiſhing their Colour from the Ground, others by the Ear, by hearing the Cock call earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly the Hen, and the Hens anſwering, and chattering with Joy at meeting, do find <hi>Partridge;</hi> yet the beſt, eaſieſt and ſafeſt way of finding them is (as you do the <hi>Pheaſant</hi>) by the Call or Pipe: Notes ſeaſonable, as before preſcribed, and they will come near to you, and you may count their Numbers; and to your ſport.</p>
                  <p>Surround your Covy, prepare your Nets, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:109118:84"/>
pricking a ſtick faſt in the ground, tye the one end to it, and let your Nets fall as you walk briskly round without ſtopping, and cover the <hi>Partridge;</hi> then ruſh in upon them to frighten them, and as they riſe they are taken.</p>
                  <p>For taking them with <hi>Bird-Lime,</hi> thus: Call firſt near the <hi>Haunt;</hi> if anſwered, ſtick about your <hi>Lime-ſtraws,</hi> a-croſs in ranks at ſome diſtance from you; then call again, and as they approach you, they are intercepted by the Straws; and ſo your Prey.

                  </p>
                  <p>The moſt pleaſant way of taking Partridge is with a <hi>Setting-Dog,</hi> who having ſet them, uſe your Net; and by theſe Rules and Method, the <hi>Rails, Quales, Moorpoots,</hi> &amp;c. are to be taken; and are for <hi>Hawks</hi> flight too.

               <p n="1">I. To know the Haunts and Reſorts of Fiſh, in which they are to be uſually found, is the moſt Material thing the Angler ought to be inſtructed in, leſt he vainly prepare <hi>how to take</hi> them, and prepoſterouſly ſeek <hi>where to find</hi> that he prepar'd for. To prevent which you are firſt to underſtand, That as the ſeaſon of the Year is, ſo Fiſh change their places: In <hi>Summer,</hi> ſome keep near the top, others the bottom of the Waters. In <hi>Winter,</hi> all Fiſh in general reſort to deep Waters. But more particularly,</p>
               <p>The <hi>Barbel, Roach, Dace,</hi> and <hi>Ruff,</hi> covet moſt <hi>Sandy, Gravelly Ground,</hi> the deepeſt part of the River, and the ſhadows of <hi>Trees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bream, Pike,</hi> and <hi>Chub</hi> delight in a <hi>Clay,</hi> and <hi>Owzie Ground:</hi> The <hi>Bream</hi> chooſeth the middle of the River, in a gentle, not too rapid Stream: The <hi>Pike</hi> preferreth ſtill Waters, full of <hi>Fry,</hi> and abſconding himſelf amongſt <hi>Bull-ruſhes, Water-docks,</hi> or under <hi>Buſhes,</hi> that under theſe ſhelters he
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:109118:85"/>
may more ſecurely ſurprize and ſeize his Prey: The <hi>Chub</hi> too chooſes the ſame Ground, large Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Streams, and is rarely deſtitute of ſome Tree to cover and ſhade him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carp, Tench</hi> and <hi>Eel,</hi> frequent foul muddy ſtill Waters. The greateſt <hi>Eels</hi> lurk under ſtones, or Roots; the ſmalleſt ones are found in all ſorts of Rivers or Soils: The <hi>Carp</hi> is for the deepeſt ſtilleſt part of Pond or River, and ſo is the <hi>Tench,</hi> and both delight in green Weeds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pearch</hi> delighteth in gentle Streams of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Depth, not too ſhallow; cloſe by a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Bank is their common Sanctuary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gudgeon</hi> covets Sandy, Gravelly, Gentle Streams, and ſmaller Rivers; not ſo much abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Brooks. He bites beſt in Spring, till they ſpawn, and a little after till <hi>Waſp</hi> time.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Salmon</hi> delights in large ſwift Rivers, which ebb and flow; and are there plentifully to be found: As likewiſe Rocky and Weedy Rivers. But in the latter end of the Year he is to be found high up in the Country, in ſwift and violent Cataracts, coming thither to ſpawn.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Trout</hi> loves ſmall ſwift purling Brooks or Rivers, that run upon Stones or Gravel, and in the ſwifteſt deepeſt part of them, getteth behind ſome Stone-block and there feeds. He delights in a Point of a River where the Water comes Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like the Eddy, to catch what the Stream brings down, eſpecially if he has the ſhade of a Tree: He hugely delights to lurk under ſome hollow Bank or Stone; ſeldom among Weeds,</p>

                  <hi>Shad, Thwait, Plaice, Peel, Mullet, Suant,</hi> and <hi>Flownder,</hi> covet chiefly to be in or near the Salt or Brackiſh Waters, which ebb and flow: The laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Flownder,</hi> have been taken in

               </p>
               <p>Thus much for the Haunts of Fiſh; I come next to know <hi>When</hi> is the moſt <hi>ſeaſonable time</hi> to catch them; which before I ſpeak to, let him that would become a compleat Angler, take this Rule. That he obſerve narrowly what Pond or River ſoever he Fiſheth in, whether it be ſlimy, muddy, ſtony or gravelly, whether of a ſwift or flow Motion; as likewiſe that he know the Nature of each Fiſh, and what Baits are moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for every kind: Not to let his Knowledg be circumſcribed to one or two particular Rivers, whither he is invited to Angle and take his Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations by the Vicinity of his Houſe; but to let his Knowledge be <hi>general,</hi> and conſequently his Sport will be ſo too. His Ignorance otherwiſe will oblige him to be a Spectator in another River, when his Excellency is confined to that only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced one in or near his own Pariſh or Houſe. But to proceed,</p>
               <p n="2">II. To underſtand the beſt <hi>Time when</hi> to Angle in, We muſt firſt conſider Affirmatively, when moſt <hi>Seaſonable:</hi> Or, 2. Negatively, when <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Seaſonable</hi> Angling is, when the Weather is calm, ſerene and clear; tho' the Cool cloudy Weather in Summer is to be preferred, provided the Wind blow not too boiſtrouſly, to hinder your eaſy Guiding your Tools; In the hotteſt Months the cooler the better.</p>

                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:109118:86"/>2. When a Violent ſhower hath diſturbed the Water and mudded it, then with a Red Worm, Angle in the Stream at the Ground.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A little before Fiſh ſpawn, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to gravelly Fords to rub and looſen their full Bellies; they bite freely.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From Sun-riſing till eight of the Clock in the Morning, and from four in the Afternoon till night for <hi>Carp</hi> and <hi>Tench.</hi> In <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July, Carps</hi> ſhew themſelves on the very rim of the Water, then Fiſh with a Lob-worm, as you would with a Natural Fly. But be ſure to keep out of ſight.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In <hi>March, April,</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> and all Winter, when the Air is clear, ſerene and warm. And after a ſhower of Rain, which hath only beaten the <hi>Gnats,</hi> and <hi>Flies</hi> into the River, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out muddying. The two firſt mentioned Months with <hi>May,</hi> and part of <hi>June,</hi> are moſt proper for the <hi>Fly;</hi> Nine in the Morning, and Three a Clock in the Afternoon, is the beſt time; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, when the <hi>Gnats</hi> play much in a warm Evening.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In a <hi>Cloudy,</hi> and <hi>Windy</hi> day, after a Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine clear Night, for the brightneſs of the Night (through fear) making them abſtain from feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Gloomineſs of the Day emboldening and rendering them (through Hunger) ſharp, and eager upon food, they bite then freely.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Laſtly, at the opening of <hi>Milldams</hi> or <hi>Sluces,</hi> you will find <hi>Trouts,</hi> &amp;c. come forth ſeeking food, brought down by the Water. We come next to demonſtrate the time not proper, <hi>i. e.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="3">III. For providing <hi>Stocks,</hi> the beſt time is the Winter <hi>Solſtice,</hi> when the Sap is in the Roots of Trees, and their Leaves gone.

In making your Line of Hair mix not Silk; but either all Hair, or all Silk; as likewiſe diſtinguiſh the Line for the Ground Angle, and that for the Fly-rod, the laſt muſt be ſtronger than the firſt; in that for the Artificial Fly, making the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Link twenty Hairs long, leſs in the next, and ſo leſs till you come to the Fly. Laſtly at each end of your Line make a Loop (called a <hi>Bout</hi>) the one larger, to faſten to, and take it from the top of your Rod, and the other Leſſer to hang your Hook-line on.</p>
               <p>Your Hook muſt be long in the ſhank, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Round in compaſs, the point ſtrait and even, and bending in the ſhank. Set on your Hook with ſtrong ſmall Silk, laying your Hair on the inſide of the Hook.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>Flote</hi> challenges divers ways of making. Some uſing <hi>Muſcovy</hi> Duck-quills for ſtill Waters.

                  <p>Of <hi>Natural</hi> Flies there are innumerable, and therefore it cannot be expected I can particularize all; but ſome of their Names I ſhall nominate, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Dun-Fly, Red-Fly, May-Fly; Tawny-Fly, Moor-Fly, Shell-Fly, Flag-Fly, Vine-Fly, Cloudy</hi> or <hi>Blackiſh-Fly, Canker-Flies, Bear-Flies,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:109118:88"/>
Caterpillars,</hi> and thouſands more, differing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Soils, Rivers or Plants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Artificial Flies,</hi> are made by the Ingenious Angler, according to Art, in ſhape, colour and proportion like the Natural Fly, of <hi>Fur, Wool, Silk, Feathers,</hi> &amp;c. To delineate which I muſt confeſs my ſelf not ſo accurate and skilful a Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor can any Pen-drawing illuſtrate their Various Colours ſo, as to direct their Artificial Counterfeit; Nature will help him in this by Obſervation, curiouſly Flouriſhing their ſeveral Orient and bright Colours, after which they take their names, as before ſaid: And therefore to furniſh your ſelf with both Natural and Artificial Flies, repair in the Morning to the River, and with a Rod beat the Buſhes that hang over the Water, and take your Choice.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Obſerve to Angle with the Artificial Fly in Rivers diſturbed ſomewhat by Rain, or in a Cloudy day, the Wind blowing gently: If the Wind be not ſo high, but you may well guide your Tackle, in plain Deeps is to be found the beſt Fiſh, and beſt Sport: If ſmall Wind breeze, in ſwift ſtreams is beſt Angling: Be ſure to keep your Fly in perpetual ſlow Motion; and obſerve that the Weather ſuit the Colour of your Fly, as the light Colour'd in a Clear day, the Darkiſh in a dark, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As likewiſe according to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Complexions, have your Fly ſuitable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let your Line be twice as long as your Rod: Keep as far as you can from the Waterſide, the Sun on your back; In caſting your Fly, let that fall firſt; your Line not touching the Water.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Have a nimble Eye, and active quick Hand to ſtrike preſently upon the riſing of the Fiſh, leſt finding his miſtake he ſpew out the Hook.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:109118:88"/>4. In flow Rivers caſt your Fly croſs them, let it ſink a little, draw it back gently, without breaking or circling the Water; let the Fly float with the Current, and you will not fail of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sport.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Obſerve to let the Wings of your <hi>Salmon-Flies</hi> to be one behind another, whether two or four, and they and the Tail long, and of the fineſt gaudieſt Colours you can chooſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> In clear Rivers a ſmall Fly with ſlender Wings is beſt, and in muddied Rivers a Fly of a more than ordinary large Body.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Red-Worm,</hi> muſt be kept in a bag of Red Cloth, with a handful of chopt <hi>Fennel,</hi> mixt with half ſo much freſh, black and fertile Mould will ſcoure and preſerve them: All other Worms, with the Leaves of Trees they are bred on, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them often in a day.

                  <p>The great <hi>White Maggots,</hi> keep them in Sheeps Tallow, or little bits of a beaſts Liver; and to ſcour them, hang them warm in a bag of Blanket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Sand.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Frogs and Graſhoppers,</hi> in wet Moſs and long Graſs, frequently moiſtned; and when uſed, the Legs of the firſt, and the Wings of the other muſt be cut cloſe off.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Flies,</hi> uſe them as you take them. Only, the <hi>Waſps, Hornets</hi> and <hi>Humble-Bee,</hi> muſt be dryed in an Oven, their heads dipt in Sheeps blood, and dryed again, may be kept in a Box for uſe.</p>
                  <p>And now thus equipt let us walk to the Rivers ſide.</p>
                  <p>To begin then with the <hi>Barbel.</hi> The beſt time for Angling for this Fiſh is at the latter end of <hi>May, June, July,</hi> and beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in his
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:109118:89"/>
Haunts aforementioned; and the beſt Bait (omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others) is the well-ſcoured <hi>Lob-worm</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a curious cleanly Palate as well as ſhape) or Cheeſe ſteept an hour or two in clarified Honey. He is a ſubtile Fiſh, extraordinary ſtrong, and dogged to be dealt with, and therefore be ſure to have your Rod and Line ſtrong and long, or you may endanger to break it.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Breame.</hi> The moſt ſeaſonable time to Angle is from St. <hi>James</hi> tide till <hi>Bartholomew</hi> tide. He ſpawneth in <hi>June</hi> or beginning of <hi>July;</hi> is eaſily taken, as falling on his ſide after one or two gentle turns, and ſo drawn eaſily to Land. The beſt Bait for him (moſt delightful to him) is the <hi>Red-Worm</hi> (found in Commons and Chalky Grounds after Rain) at the root of a great Dock, wrapt up in a round Clue. He loves alſo Paſte, Flag-Worms, Waſps, Green-Flies, Butter-Flies and a Graſs-hopper, without Legs.</p>
                  <p>Bait your Ground the Night before with groſs-ground Malt, boiled and ſtrained, and then in the morning with the Red-Worm, bait your Hook, and plumbing your Ground within half an Inch, Fiſh.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Bleak</hi> an eager Fiſh, is caught with all ſorts of Worms bred on Trees or Herbs, alſo with <hi>Flies, Cad-bait, Bobs, Paſte, Sheeps-Blood, White Snails, Waſps, Gnats,</hi> &amp;c. In a warm clear day the ſmall Fly at the rim of the Water is beſt; in a Cloudy day, <hi>Gentles</hi> or <hi>Cad</hi>-baits two foot un-the Water.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Bull-head</hi> or <hi>Millers-Thumb,</hi> being Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens recreation, I ſhall ſpeak little of them, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſerviceable for Baits, I ſhall only ſay he is eaſily taken with a ſmall Worm, being lazy and ſimple, and will ſwallow any thing; and the <hi>Minnow,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:109118:90"/>
Loach,</hi> and <hi>Banſticle</hi> being of the ſame diet, I place here too.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chevin,</hi> loveth all ſorts of Worms, <hi>Flies, Cheeſe, Grain,</hi> and <hi>Black Worms,</hi> their Bellies being ſlit, that the White may be ſeen: And very much delighteth in the Pith of an Oxes back, the tough outward skin being carefully taken off, without breaking the inward tender skin. In the Morning early angle for <hi>Chevins,</hi> with a <hi>Snail;</hi> in the heat of the day, with ſome other Bait; in the afternoon with the Fly; the great <hi>Moth,</hi> with a great Head, yellow Body, and whitiſh Wings, uſually found in Gardens, about the Evening: The larger the <hi>Chevin,</hi> the ſooner taken; loving his Bait larger, and variety on a Hook.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Char</hi> is a <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> Fiſh, found in a <hi>Mere,</hi> called <hi>Winander-Mere</hi> in that Country, the largeſt in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Chub,</hi> called by ſome a <hi>Chevin,</hi> by others a <hi>Villain.</hi> Bait your Hook with a Graſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper, find the hole where he lies, accompanied in a hot-day, with twenty or more, floating almoſt on the very ſuperficies of the Water; chooſe which you think beſt, and faireſt, and drop your Hook ſome two foot before him, and he will bite at it greedily, and cannot break hold with his <hi>Leather Mouth;</hi> let him play and tire, leſt you break your Line. If you cannot get a <hi>Graſs-hopper,</hi> then any Worm, or Fly you will. In cold Weather, Fiſh for him near the bottom, and the <hi>Humble-Bee</hi> is the beſt Bait. Some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate Baits according to the Month, but I ſhall Omit that; The <hi>Chub</hi> (being beſt and in his Prime in the Winter) a Paſte made of Cheeſe, and Turpentine, is the only Bait to take him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:109118:90"/>The <hi>Carp</hi> is ſubtle, and full of Policy, will never bite in Cold Weather, but in Hot you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too Early, or too Late. In <hi>March,</hi> he ſeldom refuſeth the <hi>Red-worm,</hi> in <hi>June</hi> the <hi>Cad</hi> bait and the three next Months the <hi>Graſs-hopper:</hi> Paſtes that are ſweet, of which I have ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are very delightful to <hi>Carps:</hi> And eſpecially, if you Bait your ground two or three dayes before you angle, with Pellets of courſe Paſte, <hi>Chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens-guts, Garbage,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gentles</hi> anointed, and a Piece of <hi>Scarlet</hi> dipt in <hi>Honey,</hi> put them on the Hook, is an approved way.</p>

                  </p>

The ſecond is called <hi>Bobbing,</hi> which is thus done: Take ſome large well ſcoured <hi>Lobs,</hi> and with a Needle, run ſome
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:109118:91"/>
ſtrong twiſted Silk through them, from end to end, ſo many as are enough to wrap about a Board near a dozen times; tye them faſt with the two ends of the Silk to hang in ſo many Hanks; then faſten all to a ſtrong Cord, and a handful above the worms faſten a Plumbet of three quarters of a pound, and your Cord to a ſtrong Pole, and in muddy Waters, you may Fiſh, and find the <hi>Eels</hi> tug luſtily, and when you think they have ſwallowed them, draw up your Line, and aſhore with them. Laſtly the <hi>Eel-ſpear</hi> made with four teeth, jagged on both ſides, ſtricken into the Mud, on the bottom of a River, and if you chance to ſtrike where they lye, you infallibly take.</p>
                  <p>There is likewiſe an aſſured way of taking <hi>Eels,</hi> thus done: Take ſome Bottles of Hay, mixt with green <hi>Oſiers</hi> or <hi>Willows,</hi> Bait them with Sheeps-Guts, or other Beaſts Garbage, ſink them down in the middle, to the bottom of your Pond or by the Bank ſides, having faſtned a Cord to the Bottles, that you may twitch them up at your pleaſure, and all the beſt <hi>Eels</hi> will reſort to them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Flounder, Shad, Thwait, Suant,</hi> and <hi>Mullet,</hi> are taken with <hi>Red-Worms</hi> of all ſorts, <hi>Waſps,</hi> and <hi>Gentles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Grayling,</hi> you muſt head your Hook upon the ſhank, with a ſlender and narrow plate of Lead, that the Bait (a large Graſs-hopper) may the more eaſily come over it; and at the point put a <hi>Cad-bait,</hi> and keep the Bait in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual motion; not forgetting to pull off the Graſs-hoppers Wings.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Gudgeon,</hi> takes the ſmalleſt Red-Worm, <hi>Waſps, Gentles,</hi> and <hi>Cadbaits.</hi> When you Fiſh
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:109118:91"/>
for him, ſtir up the Sand or Gravel with a Pole, which will make them gather thither, and bite more eagerly.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Guiniad,</hi> I ſhall remit ſpeaking to, only mentioning it in courſe, being no where found, but in a place called <hi>Pemble-Mere,</hi> in which place they abound, as the River <hi>Dee</hi> does with <hi>Salmon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Ruff,</hi> is excellent for a young Angler, bites greedily, and quantities may be tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, by Baiting the Ground with fat Earth, and your Hook with ſmall Red-Worms.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pike,</hi> loveth all ſorts of Baits (unleſs the Fly) <hi>Gudgeon, Dace, Roaches</hi> and <hi>Loaches;</hi> and young <hi>Frogs</hi> in Summer time, of which the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweſt is beſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pearch,</hi> taketh all ſorts of Earth-worms, eſpecially the <hi>Lob-worm,</hi> and <hi>Brandling,</hi> well ſcowred, <hi>Bobs, Oak-worms, Dors, Gentles, Cole-wort-worms, Waſps, Cad-baits,</hi> and <hi>Menow,</hi> or a little <hi>Frog,</hi> the Hook being faſtned through the skin of his Leg, towards the upper part of it. Be ſure you give the <hi>Pearch</hi> time enough to pouch his Bait, before you ſtrike.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Salmon,</hi> is taken beſt with <hi>Lob-worms,</hi> ſcented with the Oyl of Ivy Berries or the Oyl of <hi>Polypody,</hi> of the <hi>Oak</hi> mixt with <hi>Turpentine:</hi> Or the well ſcowred Garden-worm, is an excellent Bait: The <hi>Salmon</hi> bites beſt in <hi>May, June,</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> at three a Clock in the Afternoon, if the Water be clear, a little Wind ſtirring eſpecially near the Sea.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tench,</hi> is a great lover or large Red worms firſt dipt in Tar. As alſo all ſorts of Paſte, made up with ſtrong ſcented Oyls, or Tar, or a Paſte made up of Brown Bread, and Honey. He will
